<p>"Guard yourself against offending the hermit! But if you have done so, well then, kill him as well!"</p>

<p>I&#8217;m beginning to wonder whether this Nietzsche fellow isn&#8217;t a bit off his rocker. It not that <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0140441182/qid=1032853556/sr=1-2/ref=sr_1_3_2/202-4151198-2167858">this book</a> is exactly hard to read, it&#8217;s more that it&#8217;s impossible to understand. You get sentances (like the one above) which make perfect (if slightly warped) sense, but somehow he strings these sentances together in such a way as to make the overall meaning completely indecipherable. You can easily see how this writing has been co-opted by so many(including the Nazi&#8217;s) as some sort of justification. He says everything and nothing. Even when you&#8217;re beginning to glean some small amount of meaning from one of the passages you realise that it&#8217;s in complete contradiction to something you&#8217;d thought you&#8217;d gleaned earlier. Maybe my gleaning skills aren&#8217;t up to scratch, or maybe I&#8217;ll trying to hard to glean. Either way I&#8217;m going to plow on - if only for the sake of the &#8216;wonderful&#8217; nuggets (like the one above) which if nothing else make me giggle.</p>
