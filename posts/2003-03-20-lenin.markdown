<p>A while ago I was in a charity shop in Guiseley and I saw a metal bust of Lenin. I thought it looked cool, in a funny kind of way, and it was only a fiver. I didn&#8217;t buy it though and we wandered off through town to the library (if I remember) and so on. But I couldn&#8217;t get it out of my head and so before we returned home I went back and bought it. I got a few comical comments from the lady in the shop who&#8217;d seen me looking at it earlier and it has sat on a windowsill in our house ever since.</p>

<p class="firstpar">Last sunday the sun shone in on him so I took some pictures. He looked thoughtful there staring out of the window like he was contemplating something serious. I really know very little about Lenin, other than he was a communist leader in Russia at some point, so I haven&#8217;t a clue what he was thinking. I like to imagine it was something like &#8220;this is a nice view&#8221; or &#8220;isn&#8217;t it a sunny day?&#8221; but I fear he was probably worried about the state of the world.</p>

<p class="firstpar">Try not to worry Lenin I&#8217;m sure things will work themselves out.</p>
