title: "Drifting Back To Hierarchy (Woopah Oh Yeah Yeah!)"

standfirst: "One of my favourite things about working in multidisciplinary agile teams is the lack of hierarchy. Different people in the team have different skills and they should be self-organising as much as possible."

Teams should be making decisions in the open, discussing the options, the pros and cons and then by-and-large making the decision as a collective. Of course, disagreements can happen and I think it’s important for teams to understand that certain roles should have the “last word” in certain areas. In general though, there shouldn’t be a single person (or small group) who are running things.

In my experience, it is surprising how often teams drift back towards a hierarchical structure.

Sometimes certain roles start to be seen as more senior than others. This can often be a systemic problem with people from different seniorities (in a previous structure) being moved more predominantly into certain roles.

Sometimes the context that the team finds itself working in includes an aspect of hierarchy which starts to impose itself on the team. This means those in the team who are closer and more connected to that hierarchy become the de facto senior people.

The real trouble with this is not whether a hierarchical approach is better or worse than an non-hierarchical one (I happen to think it’s worse). The real problem is that it creates a kind of cognitive dissonance that the team then has to live with. Are we doing this one way? Or are we doing it another?

The processes and ceremonies or agile assume a multidisciplinary team. Faced with a hierarchy they stop working. Members of the team start to become confused and disconnected from the purpose and the direction that the team is going in. The things that make agile work start to get left behind. Yet people still try to keep going as if they’re still doing it causing pain and confusion.

Agile needs to be a process of continual renewal. Both in terms of the work that is being done and the ways of working we’re employing. Checking whether we’ve drifted back into a hierarchical situation needs to be an integral part of that renewal. It needs to be a question we constantly ask, and one of the key ways we judge whether an agile team is functioning correctly.

Wondering about the title? I couldn't stop thinking of this:
