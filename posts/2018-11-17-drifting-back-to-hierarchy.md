title: "Drifting Back To Hierarchy (Woopah Oh Yeah Yeah!)"

standfirst: "One of my favourite things about working in multidisciplinary agile teams is the lack of hierarchy. Different people in the team earn each other's respect not through their pay-grade or supposed seniority but through the different skills they bring to the project and the progess they help the team make."

Agile teams should also be self-organising as much as possible. They should make decisions in the open, discuss the options (the pros and cons) and then by-and-large make decisions as a collective. Of course, disagreements can happen. It’s important for teams to understand that certain roles should have the “last word” in certain areas. In general though, there shouldn’t be a single person (or small group) who is running things.

In my experience, it is surprising how often teams drift back towards a hierarchical structure.

Sometimes people start to see certain roles as more senior than others. This can happen when senior people in a previous structure are only moved into certain agile roles. Often they keep their attitude and ways of working from that previous structure (and why not? it's got them this far!). Worse still, team members who feel less senior can exacerbate the problem by being overly deferential to those people. And the cycle continues.

At other times the context that the team finds itself working in includes an aspect of hierarchy which starts to impose itself on the team. External structures, or pressures from stakeholders who aren't used to (or don't understand this way of working). This means those in the team who are more closely connected to that hierarchy become the de facto leadership.

The  problem this creates is a kind of cognitive dissonance that the team has to live with. Are we doing this one way? Or are we doing it another?

The processes and ceremonies or agile assume a multidisciplinary team. Faced with these hierarchical pressures they stop working. Members of the team start to become confused and disconnected from the purpose and the direction that the team is going in. The things that make agile work start to get left behind. Yet people still try to keep working as if they’re still doing agile.

Agile needs to be a process of continual renewal. Both in terms of the work that is being done and the ways of working we’re employing. I'm beginning to feel that checking whether we’ve drifted back into a hierarchical situation needs to be an integral part of that renewal. It needs to be a question we keep asking and one of the key ways we judge whether an agile team is functioning correctly.

Wondering about the title? You sing it, to the tune of this:
