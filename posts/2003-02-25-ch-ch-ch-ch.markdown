<p>Fuses fixed (bought some wire yesterday). I had forgotten how dark it gets at night. Kirsty wandered off to get fission chips from Harry Ramsdens (3mins walk up road, very dangerous) and I was left in our very dark house running up and down into the cellar and trying to prop up the torch so I could see to get that little bit of wire through those little holes.</p>

<p class="firstpar"><b>Also:</b> You may have noticed   that <a href="/">mydrawings</a> has been shifted <a href="/mydrawings/">slightly to the right</a> in the grand scheme of things. This is because I&#8217;m thinking of getting a new domain sometime soon and, while I&#8217;ll probably keep <i>mydrawings.co.uk</i> for the forseeable future, the 5 year plan involves it being just one section within a larger more general webiste. Don&#8217;t get me wrong we&#8217;ve had a great time together me and <i>mydrawings.co.uk</i> but over the last few months we&#8217;ve drifted apart, the passion just isn&#8217;t there anymore and those small niggly things are getting harder to ignore (for example the fact that when linking to the website nice and kind people have to have a link with the words &#8220;mydrawings&#8221; on their website which looks to all intents and purposes like it&#8217;s a link to their drawings and not my drawings etc etc etc).</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not due to renew for a little while so I&#8217;ve made the change now to give people (and Google) and chance to get used to the new situ, so when the revolution comes everything doesn&#8217;t go up the wall.</p>
