<p>We went to Otley at the weekend to try and find an art shop, which we didn&#8217;t, and to walk around a bit, which we did. I have been before and wandered around the shoppy bit which is all fair and good but never been down to the lovely open, grassy bit where a little bridge spans the river (Wharfe?) and there&#8217;s little benches and flowery bits and a wonderful view down the river.</p>

<p class="firstpar">Then we did some other stuff involving Kirsty&#8217;s friend Katie, her fella Pete, a pub, some Polish vodka, the M62, the Lowry Museum at Salford Quays, my future best man and a rather good roast chicken (even if I do say so myself). It wasn&#8217;t as hectic as it sounds, but at the end of it all we opened a bottle and sat down to a nice game of Scrabble.</p>
