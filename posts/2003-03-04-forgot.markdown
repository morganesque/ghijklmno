<p>Only went and missed <a href="http://mydrawings.co.uk/writings/1046249038/">it</a> didn&#8217;t I. After all that build up and going on and on about how I can&#8217;t wait to fucking see it and I&#8217;m damn well too bleedin stupid to set the arsing video recorder to record the freakin&#8217; thing while I&#8217;m not at bloody home.</p>

<p>As a wise man once said:</p>

<p style="padding:20px">"Don&#8217;t leave anything to this idiot he&#8217;ll probably balls it up."</p>

<p class="firstpar">Oh well can&#8217;t be helped. I don&#8217;t suppose anyone out there did record it and is willing to mail me the video? No, I didn&#8217;t think so. It&#8217;s not really the type of thing you record is it? Unless of course you&#8217;re me and you&#8217;re not going to be at home to watch it. Then you might record it. IF YOU&#8217;RE NOT TOO MUCH OF A FOOL TO REMEMBER!!!</p>
