<p>Spent the weekend celebrating Kirsty&#8217;s Mum&#8217;s Birthday drinking a big chunk of the alcohol which was meant to be drunk at the party which never happened because Ken (her husband) dove for a ball while playing cricket and fractured his collar bone as well as dislocating it and was meant to be in hospital having an operation but wasn&#8217;t because the most recent consultant he saw decided that it might heal itself in time and was probably best left although he still has a lump on his left shoudler where what ever it is is sticking up. They also have a nice new digital cam-corder.</p>

<p class="firstpar">As we all know, when someone has a cam-corder there&#8217;s a few things which we are all obliged to do.</p>

<ul>
<li>Firstly if you notice you are being recorded you must make sure we wave and grin and pull silly faces. It&#8217;s the LAW!</li>
<li>Secondly if you&#8217;re holding the camera you must be sure to try to get at least a little footage of those who don&#8217;t know they&#8217;re being filmed. We&#8217;ve all heard the mantra of the fly-on-the-wall documentary makers &#8220;it has to be real, it has to be real&#8221; and this also applies to you!</li>
<li>Finally when all the days activities are done it&#8217;s absolutely essential that you take a bit of time, sit down in the front room and watch the entire days events back from beginning to end. Obviously this won&#8217;t take as long as it took to live it (unless you literally never turned the camera off) and it will also have the added benifit that you&#8217;ll be able to see the day from a completely different perspective.</li>
</ul>
<p class="firstpar">I was wondering what effect all this has on my memory. Am I going to find in years to come that my real memories of days are replaced with the video footage I&#8217;ve watched over and over. How unreal is it for my memories to be based on video? Does the video camera necessarily have a more restricted view of events than I do? Or does watching the days events back a few times afterwards actually help to solidify your impressions and make the resulting memories strong and more lasting.</p>

<p class="firstpar">Just wondering.</p>
