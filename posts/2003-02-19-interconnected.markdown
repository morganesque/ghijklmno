<!-- more -->

<p>I don&#8217;t usually go out of my way to recommend other sites <!-- except <a href="http://sorehead.org">Kev&#8217;s</a> :o) --> but I&#8217;ve not written anything for a while so I&#8217;ll point you at <a href="http://interconnected.org/home/2003_02_16_archive.shtml#90339641">someone</a> who has. I love this blog. It&#8217;s just right. </p>

<p>Interesting theories and concepts, put forward clearly in a way that makes me wish I had far more time to sit and collect my thoughts about things before having to live life. It&#8217;s obviously written by someone with a enquiring yet playful mind and backed up with just enough knowlegde and/or research to mean it doesn&#8217;t end up like a string of what-if&#8217;s or I-wonder&#8217;s. At the same time the points are never laboured yet I find myself reading far more text than I tend to usually on weblogs.</p>

<p>The bit I&#8217;ve linked to is a particularly good example of how simple observations are pushed and pulled into interesting shapes and combined together to great effect. It&#8217;s almost like good stand up comedy - except it&#8217;s not funny.</p>
