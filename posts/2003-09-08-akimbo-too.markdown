<p>Look I&#8217;m not wanting to labour the point here or anything but he just keeps doing these things. Last night he managed this:</p>

<p><center><img src="/photos/phone/charlie_on_back_3.jpg" width="132" height="176" border="0" alt="what the?" /></center></p>

<p class="firstpar">He&#8217;s not moving there. He&#8217;s not been cruelly placed on his back and is struggling to right himself. He&#8217;s just lay like that. Like a student after a couple of pints of cider. Legs (again) akimbo, in every direction. Eyes shut purring gently, like he hasn&#8217;t got a care in the world (which of course he hasn&#8217;t).</p>

<p class="firstpar">We can&#8217;t help noticing that with those big ol&#8217; legs and the outstreched position he has the look of a rabbit or hare about him at times like this.</p>

<p>I doubt that&#8217;s the last I&#8217;ll have to say (or show) on the subject. ;o)</p>
