<p>A few things happening at the moment.
<ul>
<li>Monday and Tuesday I was off with a sickness. It&#8217;s gone mostly but what remains is mainly in my throat.</li>
<li>Kirsty&#8217;s Grandad on her fathers side died earlier this week. Kirsty is going to the funeral tomorrow.</li>
<li>There&#8217;s a great big fucking war on and the politicians are starting to say things like "Hello, it looks a bit more complicated than we thought, you won&#8217;t mind us killing a lot of Iraqis after all will you? Oh and can we have some more cash?"</li>
<li>Bought myself some nice new trainers at the weekend. I haven&#8217;t bought myself nice new trainers for ages. I used to revel in the activity. I took me back.</li></ul> and that&#8217;s about it.</p>
