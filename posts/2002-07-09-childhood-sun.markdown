<p>It&#8217;s wet, it&#8217;s raining, it&#8217;s summer. There&#8217;s no point trying to rationalise, the fact is that I remember summers, long hot summers. I remember kicking the football around on that patch of grass between the houses for hours EVERY NIGHT!! I&#8217;m not making this up. Between the ages of about 8 and 14, I&#8217;m sure of it.</p>

<p>I have a theory though. I&#8217;ve got a terrible feeling that those sunny days are there really. They&#8217;re still there waiting for me, and they&#8217;re not hiding. That&#8217;s the problem. By spending every working day sat here facing a monitor almost with my back to the nearest window, and by spending all my evenings indoors religiously, it&#8217;s me who&#8217;s hiding from them!!!</p>

<p>And I have the gaul to complain when it rains???</p>
