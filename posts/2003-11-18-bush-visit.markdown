<p>I&#8217;m off to <a href="http://www.dumfries-and-galloway.co.uk/maps/map.htm">Dumfries</a> for a few days but if you can (as <a href="http://sorehead.org/redbook/prev/000402.php#000402">Kev</a> says) <a href="http://www.resistbush.org/">Resist Bush</a>.</p>

<p class="firstpar">So the American President is coming and suddenly we&#8217;ve got <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/3279179.stm">extra security</a> around the capital because of a "heightened threat of terrorist attack". That&#8217;s a coincidence right?</p>

<p class="firstpar">There&#8217;s been more and more <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/FFB13128-DC3E-4AF9-92D0-993351193D4B.htm">comparisons</a> around recently between what&#8217;s happening in Iraq and what happened in Vietnam. The United States need to learn the lessons of that conflict. Send Rambo in early this time!!</p>

<p class="firstpar">... and if the treat from al-Qaeda doesn&#8217;t materialise, well, then those extra security measures will come in handy in making sure those pesky little demonstrators are kept in check</p>

<p class="firstpar">CNN reporter interviewing a member of the police:</p>

<div style="margin-left:20px">CNN: So how many protesters do you think turned up?
PC: Three men and a dog.
CNN: Really? There seems to be more than that to me.
PC: Yes, well the dog was barking very loudly.</div>
<p class="firstpar">&pound;5m police operation including 14,000 police officers for Mr Bush&#8217;s three-day trip. Need I say more?</p>
