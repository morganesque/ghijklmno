<p class="firstpar">Got a new computer from <a href="http://www.meshcomputers.com/">MESH</a> and it&#8217;s delicious. A little little <a href="http://www.meshcomputers.com/updated/images/systems/essential_cubex_lg.jpg">shuttle</a> box with a big big <a href="http://www.superfi.co.uk/images/c171wt_550.jpg">Iiyama screen</a> and lovely all-in-one style <a href="http://www.hardwarecentral.com/graphics/screenshots/1086470107460laio394.jpg">printer/scanner</a>. Very much more neat and tidy than the last &#8217;puter I had, and with Windows XP too which, although it&#8217;s Microsoft (and so obviously evil), I do find surprisingly easy to make work for me.</p>

<p>So all in all in all I was very happy. It also has an ethernet port (which the old one didn&#8217;t), so I can connect to my router via a network cabel (yay) and not through the USB interface I was using before (boo). Or so I thought...</p>
