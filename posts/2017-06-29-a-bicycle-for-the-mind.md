Trying to express exactly what the attraction of computers is for me is hard, but [this quote](https://www.brainpickings.org/2011/12/21/steve-jobs-bicycle-for-the-mind-1990/) from Steve Jobs has always appealed. You may have heard the "bicycle for the mind" thing before but go and read it through, I hadn’t seen the condor bit before. It’s great.

What I realise now looking at this again is that’s it’s all about energy. For bicycles, it’s the amount of energy expended versus the amount of motion generated. For computers it’s about the amount of energy expended versus the amount of effect generated. When you add the internet to the mix the number of things we can do versus the energy it takes is incredible.

As a creative person I’ve made computers my tool of choice. Luckily I’ve been able to make a career out of my use of them. For me, this puts the computer in the same category as the tools used by any craftsman. Just as carpenter might spend hours oiling the handles and whetting the blades of his tools, I want to be able to sharpen my own workflow. Shave off a few seconds here or a couple of keystrokes there.

And so not only have I learned to use computers and make them do things for me I’ve taken pride in my use of them. I’ve always been that person who’s customised all the things you could customise, who found out all the shortcuts and whizzy commands that save you time. I’ve always written little programs to help me do things. I've searched out and installed little programs built by people who have the same attitude.

Again the bicycle metaphor is apt. Anyone can grab a bike and jump on a take it from A to B. That’s fine. It’s wonderful. But if someone is really into cycling, if they do it professionally, you don’t expect that person to pick up any bike off the street and ride it. You’d expect that person to insist on a great bicycle and then to hone and tune it to suit themselves and the way they ride.

This is not some sort of vanity or fussiness. It isn’t awkward individualism. It comes from a heartfelt love of the tool and an equally heartfelt desire to do the best they can with it.

In my life, I see too many instances where people who do need to regularly ride places are given bikes that are sorely deficient. Sometimes this is just because the bike is old or cheap (I understand this because resources are not infinite and money can be scarce) but sometimes bikes people have to use have been deliberately hobbled. Broken to the point where asking a human being to try and ride somewhere on is something close to cruelty.

<p class="emphasis">Being someone who takes pleasure and pride in riding, who enjoys the wind in his hair and the excitement of speeding down a steep hill, I find this dismal.</p>

Imagine a bicycle where the safety of the rider had been prioritised so much that before starting to ride you had to take ten minutes to attach padded straps about your person. Straps that not only hindered your movement but made the quick transfer of the bike to someone else so cumbersome as to render it unfeasible.

A bike where the number of safety wheels and stabilisers attached to the bike made it almost impossible to manoeuvre on anything but a tiny set of predefined journeys.

A bike where people were employed to follow you around as you rode just to make sure you didn't ride off the edge of a cliff or ride into some fire. People who were so zealous in their pursuit of your safety that they also think it prudent to prevented you from riding over bridges or level crossings.

A bike which you were not only forbidden to try and improve or change yourself but that also needed almost constant attention from a mechanic who seemingly always had a queue of people awaiting his attention.

You see how the energy-used to effect-generated ratio had been tampered with there? To the point where a bicycle starts to be an ineffective tool. To the point where walking feels preferable because it's actually not much slower and at least you're able to exert some autonomy over it.

And yet we do need to be safe on bicycles. So what should we do?

We should wear helmets and fluorescent clothes, maybe even clip our flappy trousers a bit. Educate each other about not only the risks and explain those risks (the ways they arise and work) so we can understand and avoid them.

In other words take responsibility for our own safety, tailor our safety measures so they are proportionate to the risks involved, but without destroying our ability to use the thing for what it was made for in the first place.
