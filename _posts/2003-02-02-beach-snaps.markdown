<p>There&#8217;s some new photo&#8217;s <a href="/photos/beach_walk/">here</a> from the weekend before last when we went back to Formby to visit the parents and had a nice walk on the beach. I&#8217;ve been meaning to go back and take some pictures of all this for a while now coz it looks great and it&#8217;s where I grew up and so I&#8217;m proud that it looks great etc etc. Luckily we had a beautiful clear wintery day which was perfect for picture taking. My favourite is <a href="/photos/photodisplay.php?photoset=beach_walk&amp;photo=L3Bob3Rvcy8yMDAzLzAxL3N1bl90aHJvdWdoX3RoZV90cmVlcy5qcGc%3D">this</a> one of the sun coming through the trees, it&#8217;s got that blue circle of glare which kind of makes it look cool.</p>

<p>Oh yeah and I&#8217;ve done a new <a href="/photos/">photo</a> index thing to separate the photo bit from the blog bit .... errrr .... no reason.</p>
