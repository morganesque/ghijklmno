<p>Damn public bleeding transport, if it wasn&#8217;t so godamn public and so transportational I&#8217;d hate it and all it&#8217;s children!! I don&#8217;t want to even give them publicity by mentioning any details but I do want to say this. The only way public transport is going to get better is by more people using it and putting money into it. That means more people suffering, like me, for the good of us all. I hope you&#8217;re appreciating me Mister Mercedes-driving-leather-upholstered-listeing-to-Steps-as-you-drive-past-man.</p>
