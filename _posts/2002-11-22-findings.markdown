<p>It seems that they might have <a href="http://www.orange-today.co.uk/news/story/sm_713677.html">prooved</a> that pot has some long lasting effects on the mental health of those who use it a lot, particularly from an early age. At the end of the Today Porgramme&#8217;s segment on this story this morning they said that these finding "would serve as a warning for countries who might be planning to legalise the drug".</p>
