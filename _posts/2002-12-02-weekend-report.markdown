<p>Had a nice weekend visiting the folks back at the homestead, on the prarie, but the weather was too bad for to go to the beach so unfortunately my bumper edition of photo&#8217;s from &#8220;the beach of my childhood&#8221; will have to wait for another day. I did take a few of my childhood cat who is now something like 1000 in cat years and looking very old to boot. I might post them some time although I haven&#8217;t quite got over how upsetting it is to see the old moggy looking so much like she&#8217;s on her last legs. I picked her up at one point for a cuddle and she clung on so tightly....</p>

<p>Also went an made our first tentative Christamas decoration related purchases. The DIY stores were quite dissapointing really but we managed to pick up some funky flashing tree lights (8 different settings all as annoying as each other - ace!) and some spray snow. We also bought a papery tablecoth with Christmas trees on it - but when we got it home we found it felt more like spreading the sunday paper over the table so I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;ll be using that. I&#8217;m getting quite excited now - only 3 working weeks to go.</p>
