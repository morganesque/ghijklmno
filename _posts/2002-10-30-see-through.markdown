<p>Don&#8217;t ask me how but I ended up <a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/wishlist/transparency.html">here</a>,  where I found that my slightly guilty fondness for gimickery in my windows environment was also:</p>

<p style="margin:5px; font-style:italic">"pointless frippery that would bloat the binary to no useful purpose"</p>

<p>... but I also found links to <a href="http://www.veridicus.com/tummy/programming/powermenu/">PowerMenu</a> and <a href="http://www.chime.tv/products/glass2k.shtml">Glass2k</a>, woo hoo!. After downloading both I found that PowerMenu seems to put less of a strain on CPU memory - but Glass2k alows you to make the taskbar transparent!!. How do you make a descision like that?</p>

<p>Frippery rules!!</p>
