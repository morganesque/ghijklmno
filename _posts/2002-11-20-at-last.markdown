<p>Well, it&#8217;s been a while in planning and I&#8217;ve managed to manage it pretty badly indeed, so basically there it is. No big fan fare nothing really in the way of a celebration. Not even a small free gift for each of you. I&#8217;ve reached my 100th week of drawing drawings for this <a href="/">website</a> and I&#8217;ve also, during the same period, completed the grand total of one hundred drawings. Bringing my per-week totally finally back up to an average of one. Long may it stay that way (fat chance to be honest).</p>

<p>The ticker-tape parade will be held next Tuesday starting at Morrisons in Guiseley and ... well ... pretty much wandering home. I don&#8217;t imagine there&#8217;ll be much in the way of ticker, but I think I might still have some old tape around here somewhere.</p>
