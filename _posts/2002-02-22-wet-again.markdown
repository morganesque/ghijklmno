<p>Thought I wouldn&#8217;t be. Thought it was just a bit of a squally shower. But no. I round a corner and for the second time in recent memory (which is two times too often now and counting) I get a bucket of water thrown over me, and must sit here all morning waiting for my trousers to dry. Thank god for free coffee I say.</p>
