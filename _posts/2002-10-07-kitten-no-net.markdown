<!-- more -->

<p>Was completely without internet this weekend for a while, because our naughty little kittens had chewed through the wire. Unfortunately the upstairs phone point is right over the other end of the house from where I insist my computer must sit so we had to invest in ten meters of extension lead which I rather inexpertly left straggling around the door where I couldn&#8217;t lift the carpet enough to stuff it under </p>

<p>So having been closed out of the bedroom for leaping on our faces in the night the cats decided to reak revenge and deprive us of our information super highway. There&#8217;s nothing quite like lifting the phone and hearing no dial tone. It&#8217;s quite disconcerting. I was half expecting to peer out of the window and see the sky had fallen.</p>

<p>Situation is now mended with a new extension lead and a huge over-use of those neat little pin thingies you can buy to fix wires to the wall.</p>
