<p>Well Christmas is coming and we&#8217;ve been out today getting all the presents from Leeds. We set off early to avoid the rush but even at 9 this morning the streets seemed crowded with people. We got most of it done though and even had time to stop for a McDonalds, which we haven&#8217;t had for years; ever since we had one on a hung over morning, from the McDonalds in Guiseley, which was the soggiest most horrible McDonalds either of us had ever had. Sadly today&#8217;s was actually rather nice although it&#8217;s incredible how much you can taste the salt when you haven&#8217;t had one for a while. Interesting too how much McDonalds seems to have changed during our period of abstinence. No longer the simple burger and fries establishment of yore; now there&#8217;s all sorts of salady vegetarian type dishes on the menu. Can&#8217;t say I approve really, it&#8217;s a bit like Hitler going into childcare.</p>




<p>So we got everything (well, nearly everything) we went for and came back and I&#8217;m writing this, sat downstairs while Kirsty has a little nap upstairs. Once she&#8217;s napped we&#8217;re going to try and work out how much we&#8217;ve actually spent. All on credit card naturally! ;-)</p>




<p>Tomorrow we&#8217;re going to go and get the Christmas tree from the usual place in Pudsey and then spend the rest of the day wrapping presents and decorating the house. We&#8217;ve managed to build up quite a stash of decorations over the last few years so it&#8217;ll be quite fun dragging the box down from the top of the wardrobe and seeing what&#8217;s in there. Hopefully the Christmas lights will work but seeing as a Christmas never seems to go by without us needind a new set I&#8217;m not holding my breath.</p>
