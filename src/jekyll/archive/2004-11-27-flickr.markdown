<p>Over there on the right. I&#8217;ve added a little column of images that represents the latest uploads to this online photo management service <a href="http://www.flickr.com">Flickr</a>, which I&#8217;ve been getting into recently.</p>

<p>No doubt it&#8217;ll only turn out to be a passing fad or something but for the time being I&#8217;m going to leave it over there and see how it goes. I&#8217;m going to try and remember to take some interesting pictures with the camera in my phone, so maybe it&#8217;ll be a good way to keep this thing supplied with new content.</p>

<p>Also, you may notice that I&#8217;ve updated the design slightly. I just started tinkering and didn&#8217;t stop. Oh well, that&#8217;ll keep it going for another few months.</p>
