<p>If you&#8217;ve seen a clip of an 80&#8217;s episode of Eastenders recently you&#8217;ll have noticed like me the dull-dreary colours of the show back then. Especially in contrast with it&#8217;s contemporary counterpart. Could it be that colour capturing abilities of television equipment has improved so greatly over the years, or has the apperance and continued output of Channel 5 upped the ante on screen garishness so much that even East-gloomy-enders has been forced into discarding it&#8217;s previously restrained  palette?
