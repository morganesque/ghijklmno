<p>Another day and another day nearer to the big day of the moving. The week crawls by like a ball thrown up a hill but with only just enough momentum to reach the top. Slower and slower and slower until you&#8217;re convinced that once you get there it&#8217;ll actually come to a complete stop. Hopefully there will be enough to get us down the other side or we&#8217;ll be stuck in a continuous limbo of Saturday morning.</p>

<p>Actually that sounds really good.</p>
