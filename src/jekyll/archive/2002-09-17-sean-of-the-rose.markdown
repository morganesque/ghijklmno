<p>I finished reading <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0749397055/ref=sr_aps_books_1_1/202-1319394-0344644">The Name of the Rose</a> which was long but very good. I remember seeing the film ages and ages ago and so now I&#8217;ve read it I really want to see it again. My copy of the book had a picture of  <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Name?Connery,+Sean">Sean Connery</a> on the front and I&#8217;m being haunted by that bit in <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0749396067/qid=1032249650/sr=2-1/ref=sr_2_3_1/202-1319394-0344644">Trainspotting</a> where Sickboy is talking to Renton about Sean Connery&#8217;s career and how Name of the Rose was the one exception on a generally downward career spiral. I can&#8217;t find the godamn quote though so I&#8217;m beginning to wonder if I didn&#8217;t dream it :(</p>

<p>Then I read <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00004CJ5R/ref=sr_aps_vhs_1_1/202-1319394-0344644">The Great Gatsby</a> which was short and very good too (I&#8217;m not much of critic am I?). It wasn&#8217;t quite what I was expecting, but the reason I wanted to read it was mainly due to the fact that I kept on seeing references to it in different places and was curious - so having my expectations thwarted was part of the point.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m now reading <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0140441182/qid=1032250947/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_18_1/202-1319394-0344644">  Thus Spoke Zarathustra</a>. Yes I know, big poncy git reading philosophy. I actually bought it when I was a small poncy git, doing Art in Uni, but like the poncy git I was I never got round to reading it. So it was left on my shelf, along with the other books I&#8217;ve never read.</p>

<p>Along with the other two books I&#8217;ve mentioned actually.</p>
