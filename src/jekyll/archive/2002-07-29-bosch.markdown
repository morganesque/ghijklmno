<p>Whoah! I&#8217;m becoming my Dad more rapidly than ever. This Sunday pm found me in the garden jigsawing some laminated floor covering panels while dust billowed all around and Kirsty cooked tea!!?!?!</p>

<p>The jigsaw is this months power tool of choice (last month was the power drill with masonery bits and powerful screwdriver attachments). Like the drill it&#8217;s made by Bosch which as far as I&#8217;m concerned is the only manufacturer worth considering for such things. The word says it all ... Bosch !</p>

<p> Who&#8217;s your power drill made by? - Bosch!</p>

<p>What does it do? - Bosch!!</p>

<p>Pardon? -  BOSCH BOSCH BOSCH!!!</p>

<p>Ok, I&#8217;ve typed that word too many times, it looks all wrong now - and I&#8217;m feeling slightly dizzy.</p>
