<p>Woo hoo! My little sister is coming to stay at the weekend. She hasn&#8217;t seen the house yet, in fact she&#8217;s the last relation of either mine of Kirsty&#8217;s not to have (excluding grandparents and cousins and lost long uncles) so I&#8217;m dead excited to show her around and everything. She&#8217;s driving down from Edinburgh on Saturday with her boyfriend (who&#8217;s job pays all his petrol costs!?!?!).</p>

<p>Then next week we&#8217;ve got Kirsty&#8217;s little sister staying, so she can attend a weeks worth of work experience in sunny Leeds. Buying fashion or something (doesn&#8217;t sound like work to me!).</p>

<p>Typical, you wait around for ages for one sister and then two show up in quick succession.</p>
