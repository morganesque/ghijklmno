<p>Drove to work this morning. I&#8217;m wondering at the strange feeling of calm I have. Although the traffic was fairly hectic it is amazing what effect sitting in a comfy chair and arriving 2 seconds walk from the office has on me. I wouldn&#8217;t do it every morning (you&#8217;ve got to think in terms of that ozone layer) but boy if it doesn&#8217;t feel like all that walking and catching trains is driving me to an early grave. If it&#8217;s a choice between saving the planet or saving myself, I know what I&#8217;d choose.</p>
