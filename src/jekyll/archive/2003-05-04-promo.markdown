<p>Time for a bit of hideous self promotion now. I&#8217;ve devised a kind of system for putting the thumbnail style image for the latest drawing from <a href="http://mydrawings.co.uk/">mydrawings.co.uk</a> onto any webpage (the image will link to the front of the site). All you have to do is include the following code in the body of your web page and it will automatically update when each new drawing is published.</p>

<p class="firstpar">
<pre style="margin:10px;font:10px courier new; color:black; text-align:left;"><a href="http://mydrawings.co.uk/"><img src="http://mydrawings.co.uk/images/latest.php" width="80" height="80" alt="latest drawing" border="0" /></a></pre></p>

<p class="firstpar">This will create an image like this:<center><a href="http://mydrawings.co.uk/" ><img src="http://mydrawings.co.uk/images/latest.php" width="80" height="80" alt="latest drawing" border="0" style="border:1px solid black"/></a></center></p>

<p class="firstpar">There&#8217;s also another option. It works on the same principle but copying this code into your web page will result in a random drawing thumbnail appearing on your website (changes daily).</p>

<p class="firstpar" >
<pre style="margin:10px;font:10px courier new; color:black; text-align:left;"><a href="http://mydrawings.co.uk/images/randaily.php?page=go"><img src="http://mydrawings.co.uk/images/randaily.php" width="80" height="80" alt="todays random drawing" border="0" /></a></pre></p>

<p class="firstpar">This will create an image like this:<center><a href="http://mydrawings.co.uk/images/randaily.php?page=go" ><img src="http://mydrawings.co.uk/images/randaily.php" width="80" height="80" alt="todays random drawing" border="0" style="border:1px solid black"/></a></center></p>

<p class="firstpar">So if anyone wants to use either of these please do, obviously those of you with the HTML expertese will understand the (rather simple) way this works so feel free to change and use the code however you want. The only thing I ask is that the code should retain the link back to <a href="http://mydrawings.co.uk/">mydrawings.co.uk</a> in some way.</p>
