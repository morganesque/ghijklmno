<p>Well, as we&#8217;re being told by lots of people recently surveys aren&#8217;t always as bad as they first appear. It certainly had a few things in it that are worth looking into but we think it shouldn&#8217;t cause too many problems. The solicitor&#8217;s got it now and he&#8217;s going to write with his recommendations. So we shall see what we shall see.

<p>Went to IKEA today. Tried to miss the rush and somehow ended up right in the middle of it. If shopping is indeed a religious activity, the Sunday rush to praise the god of Swedish Design is probably one of it&#8217;s more hellish incarnations.</p>
