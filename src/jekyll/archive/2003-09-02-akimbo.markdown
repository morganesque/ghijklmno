<p>Our cat Charlie does a funny thing when you pick him up. I don&#8217;t know whether it&#8217;s the way we do it, or if it&#8217;s something about him, or even if all cats do this (although I don&#8217;t remember my parents cat ever doing it) but when you pick him up and hold him so his belly is facing up he always straightens his legs right out.</p>

<p class="firstpar">It isn&#8217;t a stretching thing, because he doesn&#8217;t just do it and then relax. He keeps the position sometimes throughout the entire duration of you holding him.</p>

<p class="firstpar">We feel sorry for him at the moment because he&#8217;s had a rodent ulcer and had to go to the vets. Also, while at the vets we were told that his teeth were not in a good state because we&#8217;ve been letting him have a higher proportion of wet food to dry food than we should. So we&#8217;re not as good cat parents as we thought we were :o(</p>
