<p>Lovely to wake up to a nice powdery, snow covered morning. Especially because by the time I had to walk to the station today the sun was up (not long ago I was walking there in darkness) and shining in an almost cloudless blue sky. The place looked wonderful.</p>

<p class="firstpar">Didn&#8217;t really get to take as many pictures of the scenery as I&#8217;d have liked because while taking photo&#8217;s with a proper camera on a day like this would be both understandable and almost commendable, taking the same photo&#8217;s with a digital camera that&#8217;s build into your phone (especially one which makes a terrible fake shutter &#8220;ker-chalk!&#8221; noise when you do) just seems poncy. So I took another picture from the window at work when no-one was looking.</p>

<p class="firstpar">Is it me or does this look like a Bruegel painting too (<a href="/blog/1077783900/">see yesterday&#8217;s entry</a>), or have a I got some kind of strange see-bruegel-everywhere syndrome at the moment?</p>
