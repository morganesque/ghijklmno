<p>The Voice is a programme on Channel 4 on Sunday night which is all about the history of singers and singing in the 20th Century. It&#8217;s really very good indeed. Last night was about male singers from Jose Carrera through Louis Armstrong, Bing Crosby, Frank Sinatra and  Nat King Cole to Elvis. Past Marvin Gaye and a soul/blues singer Bobby Bland who I&#8217;d never heard of and then on to people like John Lennon and Bob Dylan as examples of where soul and passion can completely overcome a supposed lack of technical ability.</p>

<p>The type of programme you watch and then want to go and do something creative, pick up your guitar, write yourself a song or even just mention it on your webpage.</p>
