<p>Well another week has quite illiterately flown by and it&#8217;s the weekend again. Can&#8217;t help thinking that either life has got less stressful or I&#8217;ve become less conscious. Time just isn&#8217;t meant to pass this quickly. Finished reading the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0380803771/026-5097756-7458815">biography</a> of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.billhicks.com/main/">Bill Hicks</a> this week, very cool American comedian, died of cancer (of the pancreas). The book is good but only because he was such a great comic, it doesn&#8217;t really offer more than an account of the events of his life. Started reading <a target="_blank" href="http://www.commoncouragepress.com/chomsky_consent.html">Manufacturing Consent</a> by Chomsky and Herman which is a weighty tome and no mistake. I may be some time.</p>
