<p>Went to visit a good friend of mine Steven in Bolton at the weekend, with another good friend of mine Ade. Ste cooked us a meal of chicken (something) and roast potatoes which was damn good then we went out for a &#8217;couple of pints&#8217;.</p>

</center></p>

<p class="firstpar">It all started so well, there was beer and chatting and after a while there was a quiz machine and I turned into a hyper-active chimp slapping the screen at any opportunity and getting it right maybe a quarter of the time. Then there was more beer and I can&#8217;t remember who suggested it, but then there was shots. After that things start getting hazy.</p>

<p>I remember Ste on a fruit machine and there was a huge screen with Italian football. Kirsty rang at one point, bringing the sledgehammer realisation of how drunk I was. There was another bar, and dancing although I seem to remember we were the only people in the bar dancing (I remember thinking it was a shame that more people weren&#8217;t - uungh!). Then we lost Ade and we were in another bar, then I staggered out onto the street and found him cursing us on the corner nearby. I think then we went back in, maybe there was more dancing (I use the term loosely). I think I remember asking a DJ somewhere if he "had any Frank Sinatra", and being politely told "No"</p>

<p><center>"oh that&#8217;s a shame ... Sammy Davis Junior would do ...?"</center></p>

<p class="firstpar">And then finally .... we were in a casino. Again I&#8217;m not sure how we got there, but considering how Ste&#8217;s attachment to the fruit machines had increased alongside his drunkenness I have a fair idea. I was asked how old I was (you need to be 21 to get in). What I meant to say was:</p>

<p class="firstpar">"Yes, I&#8217;m older than 21, in fact I&#8217;m actually 26 right now soon to be 27. Yes, [chuckle] I know with these boyish good looks it&#8217;s hard to believe"</p>

<p class="firstpar">What I actually blurted out was &#8220;I&#8217;M TWENTY ONE!!!!&#8221; and then had to do a lot of back peddling and showing of drivers license in order to save the situation. I remember staggering sideways at one point and thinking, bugger I&#8217;ve blown it, but apparently drunk people&#8217;s money is just as good, and we got in.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s a lot of say about the casino, but I&#8217;ll leave that for another time. Basically:</p>

<ul>
<li>I&#8217;d never been to one before</li>
<li>I became convinced my every move was being monitored like I was in some Las Vegas mafia movie</li>
<li>They seemed delighted to bring plates of free sandwiches  even though I wasn&#8217;t playing and didn&#8217;t make a single bet all night</li>
</ul>
<p class="firstpar">Ade and myself ended up leaving Ste to it on a Roulette table and wandered off to get a kebab (painfully hot chile sauce - I&#8217;m serious, it was physically painful) and went back to his flat where we fell asleep in front of Pulp Fiction on DVD.</p>
