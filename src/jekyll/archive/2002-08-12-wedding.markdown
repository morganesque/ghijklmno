<p>Went to the wedding of Ade and Gail this weekend. It was a wonderful service in Southport Town Hall and although the heavens opened at first, it soon cleared up and a great time was had. There are many photo&#8217;s to develop so watch this space for more description. Both me and she got roaringly drunk and much apologies to anyone who had to endure our rantings (especially those who maybe had to deal with us both at once). Also thanks to my mother who very patiently kept us company during the extended recovery period we spent slumped on her couch feeding each other Cheesy Wotsits and 7up.</p>
