<p>Having a bit of a quiet day (fiddling with background images) while Kirsty is out in Leeds avec sister looking for my Birthday present - woo hoo!</p>

<p>We got this lovely pack of Chicken Tikka Chiken Pieces (ready cooked and ready to eat) and I&#8217;ve just had them on a sandwich made from a third of a french stick with salad and mayo! It was a truly bodacious sandwich! Diddle-iddle-iddle-iddle-diddle (does Bill and Ted style air guitar).</p>

<p>I went and ordered those glasses the other day too. After all that &#8220;price of a small country&#8221; stuff I couldn&#8217;t find anything that came close in other shops so I thought; what the hell, you only buy glasses once don&#8217;t you?(forgetting that this is my third pair now - the first pair I left on the roof of my Dad&#8217;s car and drove off, the second pair I&#8217;m wearing right now).</p>

<p>Interesting that after asking the price the other day I then went back and asked the price again before ordering them. Again I was told that the cheapest price for lenses was �70. It was only when I was sat down giving my details to another lady that she foolishly let slip that they actually did cheaper lenses for �55. She soon realised her mistake and started ranting on about scratch resistance and glare guarding and whether I used a VDU at all, ever, but the damaged was done and I walked out having paid �15 less than I thought I was going to.</p>

<p>I wonder why the other two women didn&#8217;t tell me about the �55 lenses. Had they been trained not to? Did they notice the (rather high) expense of the frames and think "he can afford it"? They seemed so friendly and helpful too.</p>
