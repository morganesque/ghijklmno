<p>Recently I&#8217;ve found <a href="http://proce55ing.net/index.html">something new</a> (via:<a href="http://kevan.org/proce55ing/zombies/">this</a>). It&#8217;s like a programming language which sits on top of Java and hides some things you can do (which could be quite awkward for a beginner) behind much simpler commands. It&#8217;s made for people who are wanting to do visual user-interface type programming but haven&#8217;t got enough expertise to jump right in. It also has an amazing development environment that you can download which allows you to develop using a &ldquo;change and refresh&rdquo; style - which is much better for me used as I am to programming for the web. It also has a function to convert what you&#8217;ve created back into Java and save it out as a working Java applet - just click a button and there it is.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve not being playing with it for very long and I&#8217;ve already managed to come up with this:
<center><applet code="circles" archive="/java/circles.jar" width="200" height="200"></applet></center>
</p>

<p class="firstpar">Click your mouse somewhere over the square and see what happens.</p>

<p class="firstpar">That&#8217;s from someone who wouldn&#8217;t know where to begin with Java usually. It&#8217;s really that simple. I&#8217;ve done a few more things and I&#8217;m having loads of fun so I&#8217;ll stick em up somewhere at some point.</p>

<p>Oh yeah, if you&#8217;re interested, the source code for that there above can be viewed <a href="/java/circles.java">here</a>.</p>
