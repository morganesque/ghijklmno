<p>Got on that big ol&#8217; rollercoaster ride of buying a house at the weekend. We went to banks and demanded money and then went to estate agents and demanded houses and then drove around the local area being shown round houses by awfully nice people, with whom we laughed and joked about the ways of the world. There&#8217;s a current favourite, doing well, out in front by a nose. Trouble is we don&#8217;t know where the finishing post is so we don&#8217;t know whether to ride him hard and fast now or pace outrselves for the long slog. Will he tire and fall? or last the distance? Watch this space.</p>
