<p>Feeling very strange at the moment. Kind of not quite here. A little bit loosing my mind, with a pinch of vertigo about life in general. Something has changed but I can&#8217;t put my finger on what. It&#8217;s not any of the big obvious things, but something really small and trivial. Yet as with pea to princess, it&#8217;s making all the difference.</p>

<p>I seem to remember feeling similar before, and that after some time an adjustment was made and normality reigned again. I think it&#8217;s a bit like saying goodbye to one version of myself as I become another.</p>
