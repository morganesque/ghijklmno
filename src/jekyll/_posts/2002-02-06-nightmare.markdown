<p>I had a horrible dream last night that a <a href="http://www.nightmareonelmstreet.com/images/fred.gif">Freddie Krueger</a> type character was chasing me while reciting endless poetry. It was very disturbing as I was kind of aware I was dreaming and I found myself thinking "What a great idea for a film". The dream ended when the Freddie character turned into <a href="http://www.ragbone.net/shop/icon/007/f04161_jaws155_350.gif">Jaws</a> (from the 007 films) and saying something like &#8220;more power to my fingers&#8221; began to shoot me.</p>
