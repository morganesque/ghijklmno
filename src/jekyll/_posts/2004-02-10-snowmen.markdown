<p>I heard a great joke the other day:</p>

<p class="firstpar">Two snowmen in a field. One says to the other. "Can you smell carrots?"</p>

<p class="firstpar">Took me a while to get for some reason, maybe that&#8217;s why I liked it so much once I did. Plus a bit of news. I&#8217;ve recently got a new job. It&#8217;s in the same company so it&#8217;s not going to involve a different morning routine (kneel! and worship the sacred morning routine) but it&#8217;s in a different team and it&#8217;s upstairs (although the team I&#8217;m in are moving upstairs soon anyway I think - but anyway that dosn&#8217;t matter). Basically I&#8217;ll be swapping my specialised technology trousers for a slighty more creative hat. My technology trousers will be kept  safely in a closet and I&#8217;ll still be getting them out and dusting them down from time to time but maybe they&#8217;ll be slightly less important. My tatty old creative hat which has been sitting under a pile of underwear on a chair in my bedroom for a while now will have to be got out and spruced up but I&#8217;m quite pleased because I always did like the fit of that hat.</p>

<p>Yeah, so basically I&#8217;ll be going around wearing a silly hat and without a pair of trousers on. What the hell eh? It pays the rent.</p>
