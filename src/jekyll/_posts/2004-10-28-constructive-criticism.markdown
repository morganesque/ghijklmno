<p>Yay! Someone has send me a little message on the subject of <a href="/mydrawings/">mydrawings</a>. It goes like this:</p>

<p style="margin:10px; font-style:italic">Dude, I think that your drawings are not all that. Believe me I&#8217;ve seen better.</p>

<p>Isn&#8217;t it nice when people take the time to write! :-)</p>
