<p>Well stone the crows, if there isn&#8217;t a huge great toad sitting on the back of my chair today and no mistake. I frown at possibility of verisimilitude and like most days like I don&#8217;t quite realise that it&#8217;s not there. I packed my computer away the other day in preparation for the move. How many times do I have to ask for a spoon before people stop bending and stand up for themselves. Sorry, but I just thought I would today. Sense tomorrow if you&#8217;re lucky.</p>
