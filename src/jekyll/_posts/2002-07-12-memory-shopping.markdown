<p>I ordered some more memory for my wonderful (but memory deficient) computer on Monday. Being a internet friendly kind of chap I bought it online. On Monday evening I received two emails saying that my order had been confirmed and then that it had been dispatched. Yay! Both emails contained a small section saying that basically I should expect to receive the goods within two days. Yay Yay! A couple of days passed and nothing. Another day nothing. You get the gist, goddamn internet shopping let me down again. After another day I sent them a snotty email saying that they should rethink their whole life&#8217;s purpose and pull up their socks and tie their laces etc etc. Anyway it turns out it had arrived and the person who signed for it just hadn&#8217;t told me yet. Doh!</p>

<p>Internet shopping, it pays not to be too paranoid about it.</p>
