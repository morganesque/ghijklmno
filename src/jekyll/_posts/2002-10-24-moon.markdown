<p>I saw the moon this morning on the way into work. It was one of those clear little blue mornings where the moon is still ridiculously high in the sky and I thought the same thing to myself that I&#8217;ve thought on seeing this since (I think) about the age of 5.</p>

<div style="padding:10px"><i>If it&#8217;s daytime here (so we can see the sun) and we can also see the moon, does that mean in Autrailia they can&#8217;t see either?</i></div>
<p>I tried to look hard at the moon for a while and tell my brain that it was really a planet thing, like a ball which was floating out there in space. My brain wasn&#8217;t having any of it and replied that it looked too flat to be a ball. I said that, the sun being the only light source caused there to be no shading (or reflected back light) which we&#8217;d usually associate with curved objects. My brain wasn&#8217;t convinced and suggested that next thing I&#8217;d be  telling it that there were people sitting on the clouds looking down at us too. I said that yes I believed there was. My brain was taken aback for a second and said "What, really?"</p>

<p>"Oh jesus" I said.</p>
