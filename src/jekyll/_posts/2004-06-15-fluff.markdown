<p>Euro 2004 is on, German are playing Holland and winning one nill at the moment, I&#8217;ve not really been watching the first half coz I&#8217;ve been doing a new <a href="http://mydrawings.co.uk/">drawing</a> and uploading it. Having wirless and broadband now it&#8217;s much easier than it was but you still can&#8217;t do it and pay attention to the football at the same time.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve also decided to make a list, a list of things to do which I&#8217;m not getting done because I haven&#8217;t really got a handle on what I want to get done. All this is completely by the by, by the way but still.</p>

<p>Now you see if I&#8217;d have been clever I would have paused for a while, watched the match and written this at half time (which is a few minutes away now), but unfortunately I&#8217;m not that clever. Hence the need for list making I feel.</p>

<p>Anyway this has been the most self-indulgent entry I&#8217;ve written for a long time, so I think I&#8217;ll stop there.</p>
