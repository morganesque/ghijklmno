<p>Tonight&#8217;s the night and I&#8217;m feeling alright.</p>

<p>Well half of that is true. Tonight me and Kev are <a href="http://sorehead.org/images/ster_reciept.gif">off to see</a> The Two Towers!! At last. I&#8217;ve been reading the book furiously for about the last month (I read slowly) and this morning I&#8217;ve got to within the last 3 pages. I have also, however, been becoming sicker and sicker over the last few days. As usual perfectly timing the onslaught of my yearly cold to coincide with my Christmas holidays. I&#8217;m at the stage now where normally a day off work might be in order, but no, it&#8217;s LOTR tonight. I can&#8217;t not go in!</p>

<p>So I must stuggle on, like Frodo himself towards either death or glory - except with me it&#8217;s either illness or not being ill which is either way hardly a matter of life and death. Not forgetting of course that the Lord of the Rings is in fact fiction. I mean I&#8217;m not really comparing myself to......</p>

<p>You know I think I&#8217;m feeling a little delerious.</p>
