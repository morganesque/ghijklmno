<p><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><a href="http://code.google.com/android/devel/ui/hooking.html">This</a> is the first thing you need to know. Chances are you have got something in your layout XML that you want to change in some way. First you need to get hold of it!The function <span style="font-weight: bold;">findViewById</span> is your friend here.Just remember to give the thing an id in your XML file. This seems to be the way to do that: <span style="font-weight: bold;">android:id="@+id/fish"</span>. The important bit, as far as I can work out right now is the + sign in there. It seems to mean "if you don't know about this already that's cool, just create it!" which doesn't make a huge amount of sense to me yet - but it works.</div></p>
