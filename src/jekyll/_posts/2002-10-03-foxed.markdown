<p>Lock up your sons! Basil Brush is back and this time he&#8217;s <a href="http://www.ananova.com/news/story/sm_683209.html">gay</a>!!</p>

<p>Obviously taking their inspiration for this change from the character of <a href="http://www.droogz.co.uk/movies/WITHNAIL/monty05.jpg">Uncle Monty</a> in Withnail and I, the BBC have decided to bring back the brush in a new childrens show callled Foxed.</p>

<p>Foxed?!?!</p>

<p>We can only hope this isn&#8217;t already some kind of HaXor slang for something else...</p>
