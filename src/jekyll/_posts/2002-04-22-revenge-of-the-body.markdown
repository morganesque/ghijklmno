<p>Had a cold, so coughed and sniffled through the weekend like a good &#8217;un. Then on Sunday the sun came out my nose cleared and I started to feel human again only to have my wisdom tooth (left side) start to hurt like a field  of painful lettuces.
</p>

<p>Anyway so now I&#8217;m nursing a swollen face and swilling back anticeptic mouthwash in a desperate attempt not to have to visit the emergencey dentist.
</p>

<p>They have emergency dentists you know - no really they do.</p>
