<p>In the morning I go to the station <center><img src="/photos/phone/station.jpg" /></center></p>

<p class="firstpar">and get on a train <center><img src="/photos/phone/train.jpg" /></center></p>

<p class="firstpar">Only not that train coz that&#8217;s the train going to Ilkley and I get on the train going to Leeds. I couldn&#8217;t take a quick picture of the train I get on coz as it&#8217;s coming into the station I&#8217;m too busy jostling for position with all the other bleary eyed commuters for whom, at this time of the morning, the possibility of not getting to sit down for the 15 minute trip to work is assuming a life threatening significance.</p>

<p class="firstpar">Then I arrive to work <center><img src="/photos/phone/marshall.jpg" /></center>at a <a href="http://www.theotherpages.org/poems/blake01.html">dark satanic mill</a> (which is nether green or pleasant).</p>

<p class="firstpar">Unlike our new lawn which is now down and laid <center><img src="/photos/phone/new_lawn.jpg" /></center></p>

<p class="firstpar">I&#8217;ve just got a new phone, hence all the pictures. Fun!</p>
