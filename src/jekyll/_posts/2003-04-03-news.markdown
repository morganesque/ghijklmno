<p>Right yes, I threw everything up in the air and I haven&#8217;t really been making much of an effort to see where it all fell, so here&#8217;s a bit of an update for those who are still watching.</p>

<p>This <a href="http://ghijklmno.net">http://ghijklmno.net</a> is the new thing where there isn&#8217;t much going on yet but maybe there will be soon. This <a href="http://mydrawings.co.uk/">http://mydrawings.co.uk/</a> is the old thing and is back from being here <a href="http://ghijklmno.net/mydrawings/">http://ghijklmno.net/mydrawings/</a> (although it&#8217;s still there really - ssssh we don&#8217;t talk about that).</p>

<p> This <a href="http://ghijklmno.net/blog/">http://ghijklmno.net/blog/</a>  is the new version of this <a href="http://mydrawings.co.uk/writings/">http://mydrawings.co.uk/writings/</a> (the latter you&#8217;ll find now redirects to the former).</p>

<p>Finally this <a href="http://ghijklmno.net/birdplant/">http://ghijklmno.net/birdplant/</a> and this <a href="http://mydrawings.co.uk/birdplant/">http://mydrawings.co.uk/birdplant/</a> are completely identical (why have I got them both there? - Because I bloody well can, that&#8217;s why!).</p>

<p>And that&#8217;s about it. There might be the odd other thing dotted around but that&#8217;s another story for another day buddy.</p>
