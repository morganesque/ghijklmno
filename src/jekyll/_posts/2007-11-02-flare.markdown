<p>I&#8217;ve been having a look at the <a href="http://flare.prefuse.org/">Flare</a> actionscript library for creating interactive visualisations and the like. Interestingly they&#8217;ve packaged in a <a href="http://osflash.org/tweener">Tweener</a> like tweening library and a physics library too. Considering I&#8217;ve been using <a href="http://osflash.org/tweener">Tweener</a> loads and I&#8217;ve been looking at <a href="http://www.cove.org/ape/">APE</a> a bit recently too I wonder whether this would be a good replacement for both or is a bit limited to what they&#8217;ve wanted to achieve within Flare. There's an <a href="http://flare.prefuse.org/demo/">excellent demo</a> and API documentation. I'm mostly interested in the <a href="http://flare.prefuse.org/doc/api/flare/vis/operator/layout/ForceDirectedLayout.html">ForceDirecedLayout</a> but being in alpha at the moment it seems that they haven't got round to examples and tutorials for that aspect. One to watch though I think.</p>
