<p>Maybe that&#8217;s it. Maybe you&#8217;re not being payed for your skills or for your ability but you&#8217;re actually being payed just to make the journey every morning and to stay in one place for 8 hours a day. In exchange for the money you require to live and luxuriate you&#8217;re agreeing not to do anything more worth while with your life. It&#8217;s not selling your soul, it&#8217;s not that pro-active.</p>
