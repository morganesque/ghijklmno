<p>Hmmm what can you say about life eh? One minute you&#8217;re there the next you&#8217;re not. One minute you&#8217;re happy the next you&#8217;re sad. One minute yo... you get the idea. And usually there nothing more to explain it than a heartily good breakfast or sleepily stumbling into the wall as you stagger out of bed in the morning. The road forks and you&#8217;re left holding the baby. The child of circumstance. The progeny of fate. The sprog of chance.</p>

<p>Audience: WTF?!?!</p>
