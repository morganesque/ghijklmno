<p>Photographs! Phousands of &#8217;em! </p>

<p>Well no, but I few it thought might be nice to put up here. They&#8217;re kind of organised into sets (as is the fashion) and there&#8217;s links to them at the bottom of the menu down there. Hopefully these&#8217;ll be followed by more but judging by how long it took me to sort this lot out then I&#8217;ll have to see. I&#8217;m off work at the moment (I know you all know, but maybe, just maybe there&#8217;s someone reading this who I don&#8217;t speak to on a daily basis) so I&#8217;ve had a bit of time to monkey around with everything which has been nice.</p>

<p>Also I&#8217;ve done a css display thing (link at bottom) which displays the css for this page. Christ knows why I&#8217;ve done this, but I kind of wrote the code and then thought &#8220;What the hell&#8221; and stuck it up here. I&#8217;m in the middle of doing a rotating-style sheet thing for this blog so maybe once that&#8217;s up and running it&#8217;ll make more sense. I can&#8217;t decide whether I want the style to change every day or just once a week, so errrr ... answers on a postcard.</p>

<p>Happily I&#8217;m having one of those weeks off where it&#8217;s feeling like ages and ages since I&#8217;ve been in work so I feel like saying &#8220;Hello, remember me?&#8221; to work people. I&#8217;m fulling expecting everyone to say &#8220;My, haven&#8217;t you grown&#8221; when I return.</p>
