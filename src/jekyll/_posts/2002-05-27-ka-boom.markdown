<p>When I imagine a huge cannon (like the one in <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0050858">The Pride and the Passion</a> (starring Frank Sinatra and Cary Grant) I imagine the noise it makes is something like "BOOM". It&#8217;s certainly a single syllable kind of sound. I imagine the same kind of noise for nearly all explosion-type events.</p>

<p>So where do we get the word &#8220;KA-BOOM&#8221; from? Does it come from a real life phenomenon? Is there a kind of two syllable explosion which happens in some situations?</p>

<p>Also, why is &#8220;KA-BOOM&#8221; so obviously bigger than "BOOM"? Why does that extra syllable give it so much extra umph?</p>

<p> I&#8217;m thinking that maybe it&#8217;s the equivalent of that momentary recoil that cartoon characters do before actions sometimes. Something entirely fictional which none the less seems to emphasise the following action?</p>
