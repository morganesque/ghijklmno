<p>We&#8217;ve eventually got blinds. After buying some and finding that they didn&#8217;t have half the ingredients needed to put them up; trying to take them back Tuesday night only to get stuck in horrendous traffic (due to weather obviously!?!); taking them back the following night; finding some new ones (in a different store); going back to measure to be certain (experience shows you can never be too certain); and then going back again to buy them only to find the bleedin place shut it&#8217;s doors literally a second before I was going to walk through them... We now have blinds.</p>

<p>Next thing I suppose would be to put them up.</p>
