<!-- more -->

<p>After the over-whelming number of requests I&#8217;ve had, I&#8217;ve decided to put up a picture of the new <a href="/images/my_house.jpg">house</a>.  I&#8217;t s a semi so our bit is the part closest to you (this side of the white door). Isn&#8217;t it nice?</p>

<p> Anyway, cunning spotter <a href="http://sorehead.org">Kev</a> has noticed that if you look carefully you can actually see a hand in the doorway. That is me putting a new Yale lock on the front door. I had to chisel a large part of the door frame away in order to fit it - so that&#8217;s me mid-chisel. I only mention this because if any of you are thinking "aha now I know where he lives I&#8217;ll go and rob him", you&#8217;ll be sorely dissapointed when you come up against that Yale lock my friend - it&#8217;s absolutely enigmatic in it&#8217;s power and complexity!!</p>
