<p>A pinch and a punch for the first of the month. The pinch can be for me, for a pinch of herbs and a pinch of spices (and probably a great wodge of curry powder). You see I skillfully roasted a chicken yesterday using our new electrolux &#8220;king-of-all-ovens&#8221; oven. It worked like a dream and there was even some leftovers, so tonight is curry night. I want to say Ole&#8217; but I feel that it far too continental and not indian enough for what I&#8217;m trying to convey.</p>

<p>The punch I&#8217;d like to donate to a usual suspect who fate has conspired to elevate while I languish. &#8217;nough said.</p>
