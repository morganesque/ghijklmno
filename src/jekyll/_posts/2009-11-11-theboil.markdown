    Is it really steam that heats the bi-metallic strip that cuts the power? Or just the temperature of the water? In fact, where is the strip? In the water or in the steam? I'll have to take the kettle apart to find it! Maybe you can bend it so that it cuts off sooner .. or maybe there is already a kettle that cuts off at 95 degrees. Did you know that water only turns to steam at 100 degrees at normal atmospheric pressure? It the top of a mountain the pressure is less and the water boils at less than 100 ... maybe even 95! At the bottom of a deep well it will be hotter when it boils ... maybe 105!!
    In fact at the bottom of the ocean the pressure is very high and I bet you can't get water to boil at all ... especiall as it will be constantly diluted by all that water. Not to mention salt ... that will increase (it&#8217;s called elevate) the boiling point even more! Now look what you&#8217;ve done to my brain! ... I'll have to have another glass of wine or I won't be able to sleep for thinking about it.

    pressure so maybe the  thing needs to be fairly crude in order to work in lots
    of different settings, stopping exactly on 95&deg;C might be a tall order (although
    if someone's making a cup of tea down at the bottom of a deep well I'd tend to
    forgive a little extra energy consumption as they&#8217;ve probably got more pressing
    issues)."

  content: 'Hmmm I only have the internet as authority on the steam heating the strip.
    I read it here: http://wiki.answers.com/Q/How_does_an_electric_kettle_work.
    However I think there''s some places where they claim it''s due to the pressure
    of the steam building up. Not sure about this but it still begs the question:
    can we make them stop <i>before</i> the steam is created?'

    We waste loads of energy &amp; money due to inefficient use of the kettle. The biggest issues are a) putting in too much water and b) boiling the water before we need it so it is 'almost ready' when we want a coffee half an hour later! A simple economy measure would be to buy a smaller kettle ... say 2 cups size, and keeping a bigger one for when you have visitors.
    I have acquired one of those electricity monitoring devices that clips onto your meter. We can now see the power consumption suddenly increase when we switch on the kettle ... up by 2500watts (the whole house is normally ticking over on about 500watts due to lights TV, fridge, computer etc.)

<p>Look at this graph. It&#8217;s a graph from a website but it looks very similar to a graph in a science experiment I did at school.</p>

<p><a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/thermo/phase.html"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-86" title="Water phase change" src="/img/2009/11/boiling.gif" alt="A graph of the phase changes of water." width="100%" style="max-width:511px;" /></a></p>

<p>It basically tracks the temperature of water as you heat it. All the way from ice through it&#8217;s melting point (0&deg;C) up to and through it&#8217;s boiling point (100&deg;C). Ha, like you didn't know that.</p>

<p>What I want to discuss is the point at the top of the graph there where the water turns into steam, where it boils. I remember the lesson where we drew this graph. I don't really know why although I think perhaps that it&#8217;s because of that point at the top of the graph. What we found was that as you heat the water consistently the temperature increases, also consistently, up to a point (100&deg;C) and at that point the temperature stops increasing. The reason it stops is because although you're applying heat to the water the energy of that heat is no longer being used to raise the temperature but to convert the liquid into steam. They call it a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_%28matter%29#Phase_transitions">phase transition</a> and it requires energy. You can see in the graph there that it takes quite a lot of energy because it takes quite a while for the temperature to start increasing again.</p>

<p>Right so where are we? We're heating water. Good because kettles is what I really want to talk about. With your kettle you heat water and this happens using electricity which is forced through a wire which is resistant to having electricity forced through it, and because of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heating_element">the way of the world works</a> this resistance causes the wire to heat up (think of it as angry at the imposition) and this heats your water.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s not the only thing kettles do. Most kettles nowadays perform the neat trick of turning themselves off again after the water is boiled. This saves the element from getting too angry (furious?) and stops the whole process before all the water has turned to steam so you&#8217;ve got some left to drink.</p>

<p>I wasn't sure how kettles did this so I looked it up. It turns out they use a thing called a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bimetallic_strip">bimetallic strip</a>. This is something else I learned about in school (oh, the british education system). Basically this is a small strip made of two types of metal, one on one side and the other on the other. The trick is that one metal is more susceptible to heating up than the other meaning it expands more causing the strip to curl as one side gets longer faster than the other.</p>

<p>This is very handy when it comes to turning things off when they get hot. Basically you set up your strip in such a way as it trips a switch when it gets hot and you&#8217;ve got a self-turn-offing kettle. Woot!</p>

<p>Can you see the problem yet? Right here's the thing. Most kettles are set up in such a way as their bimetallic strip is heated by steam. This steam is created as the water boils and so it a pretty good indicator that the water is boiling, and is therefore a pretty good indicator that the kettle should now be turned off. But wait! Why are we using the kettle in the first place? To heat water. Our goal here is hot water not steam. Think back to the graph. After the water reached 100C the energy we're adding is being used only to create steam. So when it comes to the kettle all of that extra energy is being used for no other purpose than to turn the kettle off. It&#8217;s not making our water any hotter because it&#8217;s already as hot as water can get.</p>

<p>So some questions:</p>

<p>Is there any reason you know of that when making tea or coffee or another hot-style drink we actually need the water to have reached boiling point beforehand? Would water that has reached say 95&deg;C not work or be wrong in some way?</p>

<p>Secondly is there not some way that we could create a mechanism for turning kettles off when the water temperature gets to 95&deg;C? How much might that add to manufacturing costs? Might that cost be acceptable to consumers both on economical and environmental grounds?</p>

<p>Finally has this blatantly already been covered, done, dusted and succeeded or failed, or is on the point of breakthrough, or something in some way that I haven't heard of and therefore I'm either totally behind the times or simply just mildly irrelevant?</p>

<p>I'm obviously worried that perhaps I&#8217;ve missed something fundamental here which renders this whole argument pointless, but as it stands there's something tantalisingly promising to my mind about the idea of saving all that energy (which as I&#8217;ve <a href="http://ghijklmno.wordpress.com/2009/10/23/electricity-monitor/">found out recently</a> is quite a lot) simply by not having kettles across the world have to be on for as long.</p>

<p>Answers on a postcard (or in the comments) please.</p>
