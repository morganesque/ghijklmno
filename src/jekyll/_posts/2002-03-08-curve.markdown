<p>Learning curves tend to be exponential in nature (e.g. y = x<sup>0.9</sup>). At the start you learn a lot very quickly, but as time goes by the curve becomes less steep and your learning becomes slower and less significant. Eventually you reach a point where the ground is almost level yet however long you trudge you will never reach the summit. Maybe it&#8217;s time to find a new curve.</p>
