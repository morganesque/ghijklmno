<p>This weekend I attended a stag weekend in Edinburgh prior to next weeks happy hitching of Adrian to Gale.</p>

<p>Got the train from Preston which was packed to the brim with people going up for the festival, and a surprising amount of other stag/hen parties. Needless to say a train had been cancelled earlier meaning our poor carriage had the task of carrying twice it&#8217;s capacity, and even more needless to say there was no chance of us getting to sit in our pre-booked seats. So we toodled off to first class and sat there for the entire journey, free of any upgrade charge and very comfortable thankyou-kindly (much to the chargrin of those already there).</p>

<p>Stag do was great with much drinking and .... errr... well much drunk.</p>

<p>Needless to say, we didn&#8217;t get to sit in first class on the way home.</p>
