<p>You know what happens a lot. I bring up Outlook to write an email and I notice that I&#8217;ve got a couple things in my inbox. One of them has got a link in it and so I have a quick look. Before I know it I&#8217;ve spent 10 mins reading some website and I&#8217;ve totally forgotten what it was I&#8217;d wanted to write and to whom. What I need is a little widget that knows that I didn&#8217;t bring Outlook up to check emails, and when I go to check them it pops up a window saying "No, write that email first and then you can look".</p>

<p>It would have to be connected to my brain and would have to be able to distinguish between &#8220;open-to-write&#8221; and "open-to-check", but I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s possible.</p>
