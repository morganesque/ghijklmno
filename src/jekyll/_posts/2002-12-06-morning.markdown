<p>Exactly 1 minute into the song called &#8220;Ce Matin La&#8221; by the french band Air there&#8217;s a brass insturment part. I don&#8217;t know whether it&#8217;s a muted trumpet or even a trombone, it might even be another kind of instrument altogether or maybe it&#8217;s a wonderful synthesisation. It follows a long airy introduction, which to be honest I hardly ever listen to anymore, having discovered that the trumpet begins at exactly 1 minute in.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a wonderful sound like someone saying &#8220;pah&#8221; through cotton wool, yet it&#8217;s elongated and fades off beatifully. I imagine such a trombone solo might be playing as you accend the great white escalator to heaven.</p>

<p>Obviously there&#8217;s a huge easy listening influence (I&#8217;m imagining the great smiling face of Burt Bacharach beaming down on this heaven) and later the track merges itself into almost a &#8216;best of&#8217; of sounds from the easy listening ouvre, but it&#8217;s just that moment when the noise kicks in, it&#8217;s just that feeling, no matter the context or the cloudiness of the day, that makes me feel happy.</p>
