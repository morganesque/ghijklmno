<!-- more -->

<p>Well since those scans (still on the right there) a lot has happened. We&#8217;ve been getting equipped with a cot and a buggy/pram and lots of tiny little clothes which Kirsty insists on hanging up on the little hangers they came on. We now have a cupboard in the back bedroom that could knock you over at 100 paces with the sheer cuteness of it&#8217;s contents.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ve been to 2 parent classes together (Kirsty goes to extra separate women-only ones) and learned all about things which we&#8217;d already really read in books but somehow seemed more real when a person was saying them out loud. We also met a Mum and Dad with their 12 day old son who had been persuaded to come back in and tell us that "it&#8217;s OK, you will survive".</p>

<p>Water birth seems to be the order of the day, and I must admit the more I hear about it the more my preconceptions about new-age, crystals and joss-sticks type people are falling away. At the end of the day it&#8217;ll be whatever suits best at the time I guess, but for the time being that&#8217;s the plan.</p>

<p>So, we have a plan, we&#8217;ve packed some bags, parents and relatives know to expect a call (when we&#8217;re all done!) and there&#8217;s still over 3 weeks to go! I never thought I&#8217;d say this but I&#8217;m beginning to actually feel ready!</p>

<p>Bring it on!!!</p>
