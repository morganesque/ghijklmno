<p>We&#8217;ve just got back from having a <a href="http://www.leedsscreeningcentre.co.uk/4D.htm">4D scan</a> of our baby at the Leeds Screening Centre. It&#8217;s like a normal scan only instead of just seeing a "slice" of the baby at a time, they create what looks like a 3D moving image of your baby in real-time.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve stuck up <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/ghijklmno/sets/296196/">some photos of the scan</a> if you want to go and have a look, you can probably also see them on the right of the page there. She had her arm up next to her face for quite a while but with a bit of jiggling (well, actually quite a lot) she moved it enough for us to get a good look at her.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ve got a DVD of the whole scan thing and a CD full of images, so we&#8217;ve really very pleased.</p>
