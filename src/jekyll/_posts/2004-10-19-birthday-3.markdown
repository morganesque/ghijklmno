<p>Well today was my birthday and what a smashing birthday it was too. Kirsty bought me all sorts of presents including a funky t-shirt, a new wooly hat and two new books! I love it when she does that.</p>

<p>I had the day off work so we mooched about lazily all day and went wandering in Guiseley. Then she cooked lasange (as only she can) for tea and we cracked a bottle of wine and watched a DVD. Perrrrfick!</p>

<p>Thanks to everyone who sent a card I knew it would pay off remembering all your birthdays all year! ;-)</p>

<p>Still no real news about the job thing, I hope we&#8217;ll find out by the end of the week, but I guess it&#8217;s more likely to be next week now. Boo.</p>

<p>Oh well chin up...</p>
