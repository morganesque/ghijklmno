<p>Phew! Now then, well ... </p>

<p>How are you doing? Glad you made it. Like the new colours?</p>

<p>As you may be able to see I&#8217;ve made a few changes both to the main mydrawings part and to this my humble weblog. As usual this is totally needless and completely pointless other than to amuse myself with by perpetuating my own personal myth that someday I&#8217;ll have prefected the workings of this website and fame fortune and vast tubs of lard will follow. In lieu of explanation I would just say that I&#8217;m trying to make it less confusing for people who arrived at a website called mydrawings.co.uk only to find a load of writings. Also by sticking the latest one right there in front I&#8217;m trying to shame myself into doing more.</p>

<p><b>To catch up</b>We now have kittens. One of them is regularly shitting in selected places around the dinning room.</p>

<p>Yay!</p>
