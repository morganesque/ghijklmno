<p>Quick update (and thanks to <a href="http://minddump.co.uk/index.php?show_id=81177968&amp;comment=show&amp;form=ja#81177968">Josie</a> for her good advice). The cats are settling in better now. The shitting-all-over-the-damn-place problem was down to us (stupid humans) buying them the wrong flavour of litter for their litter tray. We tried a new type (called Fullers Earth!?!) and they loved it. In fact you could actually feel their relief. As soon as the litter hit the tray they were both queuing up to &#8217;do their business&#8217;.</p>

<p>We&#8217;re so proud</p>

<p>Anyway that&#8217;s all for the poo. From now on I promie there will just be tales of cuteness, playing with scrunched up pieces of paper and chasing each other around the house like mad feline banshee-devils.</p>
