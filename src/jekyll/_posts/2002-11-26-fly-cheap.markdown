<p>You know how big airline companies are trying to cash in on the budget market by launching their own little no-frills airlines. British Airways lauched &#8220;Go!&#8221; (but then had to sell it) and other&#8217;s have done the same. Well <a href="http://www.flybmi.com/bmi/en-gb/index.aspx">British Midland</a> (BMI) have a similar budget company of their own, and what have they called it?</p>

<p>Why, it&#8217;s called "<a href="http://www.bmibaby.com/bmibaby/en-gb/index.aspx">BMIBaby</a>" of course.</p>

<p>Excellent.</p>
