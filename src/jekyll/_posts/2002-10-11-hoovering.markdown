<p>Doing the hoovering last night I reached a conclusion about the why I hoover. When I hoover I&#8217;m not hoovering because the floor needs hoovering, I&#8217;m hoovering in order to prevent the floor ever reaching the stage where it actually needs hoovering, and so, because I regularly hoover the floor will never need hoovering.</p>
