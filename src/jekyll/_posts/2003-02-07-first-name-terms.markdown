<p>Have you noticed that Tony Blair (and I think George Walker Bush) always refer to the Iraqi leader as &#8217;Saddam&#8217;? Not Saddam Hussien, or Mr Hussien. Is there a good reason for this? I can just imagine Saddam appearing on Iraqi television and saying "We are going to fight to repel the immanent invasion of Tony and George".</p>

<p>Last night on TV Tony argued that although there was no evidence for a connection between Al Qaeda and Iraq in the past, there was no saying what with Iraq under threat of attack, that  the two wouldn&#8217;t be brought together in the future. What Tony? You mean your threat of attack? So you reasoning here is: what with us threatening to invade Iraq he&#8217;s bound to join forces with terrorists and so we should definitely invade Iraq to stop him joining forces with terrorists???</p>

<p>I finished watching with one thought: if we let them go to war now, based on the arguments they&#8217;ve put forward then we&#8217;re basically giving them the right to continue doing this indefinitely. There will always be a threat and after this that threat will be an easy excuse for war. And war. And war and war and war.</p>
