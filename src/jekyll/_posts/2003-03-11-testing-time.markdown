<p>Heard on the radio this morning that there&#8217;s a new plan from the UK to try and make a second UN resolution more palatable for the rest of the world.</p>

<p class="firstpar" style="margin:10px"><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/2838607.stm"><i>"UK ambassador Jeremy Greenstock is expected to give details of the new proposals to the Security Council when it meets on Tuesday. They are reported to include a series of disarmament tests which Baghdad should fulfil within a set time limit, after which it will face war."</i></a></p>

<p class="firstpar">A series of tests you say? Will these be a little bit like the &#8220;series of tests&#8221; that you&#8217;ve put in place to decide whether we join Euroland then? A series of test that can be interpretted in so many different ways that&#8217;s it&#8217;s possible for you to do whatever you like whenever you like and still use them as justification?</p>

<p>Better not mix them up or we&#8217;ll be launching an unjustified attack on Europe and sharing a common currency with Saddam!! Ha ha of course not coz that would be ridiculous wouldn&#8217;t it.</p>
