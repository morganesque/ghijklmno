<p>Well, what the Sam Hill has been going on recently? "Certainly nothing worth writing about" I hear you say. Well, probably that&#8217;s true, although I&#8217;ve also been a bit lazy, and have suddenly been doing a few drawings instead (you can&#8217;t have both you know!).</p>

<p>Life has been continuing. We&#8217;ve been battening down certain hatches ready for the winter. Painting exterior surfaces and fences and screwing things down (and together). We&#8217;ve been visiting The Rubbish Tip, sorting stuff right out, and planning (don&#8217;t forget the planning).</p>

<p>Aha, also my best man (remember him?)</p>

<p>got engaged to the lovely Maeve in Edinburgh this weekend. So congratulations to him, we really could not be happier for them both!</p>

<p>The wind is up boys and girls, but the sun is still shining, so enjoy it while you can and don&#8217;t, whatever you do, expect an umbrella to be of any use at all.</p>
