<p>Friday is here, Friday is here. Me and my lady and my sore throat are going to Manchester tomorrow to see &#8220;Midsummer Nights Dream&#8221; woo! And to see my esteemed father who reaches the grand old age of 55. He&#8217;s a lovely Dad and he deserves something nice so were going shopping tomorrow to buy him a present. I don&#8217;t know what it is yet, but I know it&#8217;s in Leeds City centre somewhere. It&#8217;s just a matter of finding it.</p>
