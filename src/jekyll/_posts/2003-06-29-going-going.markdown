<p>You know that feeling when you&#8217;ve got something to say but you can&#8217;t say it, and because you can&#8217;t say it you can&#8217;t say anything else. It&#8217;s like when you&#8217;ve got a question that you&#8217;re wanting to ask but you feel like you&#8217;ve got to make small talk first before you can ask, but consequently you can&#8217;t think of anything else to say because the only thing on your mind is the question. Or like when you&#8217;ve got something to confess and until you&#8217;ve admitted it you can&#8217;t concentrate on anything else.</p>

<p class="firstpar">I haven&#8217;t quite been able to say anything properly for a while now.</p>

<p class="firstpar">Around this time last year we bought our first house which was a big deal. About a year before that we bought a new Ford Ka, which felt like a big deal. About a year before that I got my first job which after about 9 months of signing on was a very big deal. Around about a year before that I finished Uni. Of course I&#8217;ve|we&#8217;ve  done all sorts of other things in that time but those things kind of stand out - maybe artificially - because they were all done around the spring/summer of subsequent years.</p>

<p class="firstpar">The scrolly wheel on my mouse in work has started to click loudly whenever I scroll upwards. It&#8217;s fine when I&#8217;m scrolling down though.</p>

<p class="firstpar">I&#8217;ve re-invigorated my <a href="/blog/rss.php">RSS</a> and <a href="/blog/rdf.php">RDF</a> (is that what they&#8217;re called?) feeds just in case that&#8217;s of use to anyone.</p>

<p class="firstpar">Also, also also, I&#8217;ve added something to this blog to enable me to keep posting while I&#8217;m on holiday, I&#8217;m not sure whether it&#8217;s going to work though, so it might be interesting to check while I&#8217;m away. I won&#8217;t be able to check myself so if it all goes bad it might be quite amusing.</p>
