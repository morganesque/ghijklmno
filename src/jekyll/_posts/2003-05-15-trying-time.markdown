<p>Yet more disturbing <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/views03/0513-10.htm">stuff</a> about the real story of the Iraq war.</p>

<p class="firstpar">I&#8217;m trying to build up an idea in my mind of exactly what I think is happening but it&#8217;s quite hard when there always seems to be new things to take into account and new theories as to why and how. What is clear though is that  the gross simplifications we&#8217;re being sold at the moment by politicians and the media are as good as (and at the same time worse than) lies.</p>

<p>However, I&#8217;m trying to build up an idea in my mind of exactly what I think is happening and it&#8217;s becoming more and more clear that things are far too complicated for me to assimilate without more research and far more thought. I&#8217;m also beginning to think that the search for a Big Theory to understand what&#8217;s going on is probably just as flawed as those gross simplifications.</p>

<p>But, I&#8217;m trying to build up an idea in my mind of exactly what I think is happening so although I&#8217;m wary of gross simplifications, I find myself less wary of those less gross simplifications and ideas which seem to provide a Big Theory to explain what&#8217;s going on.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m trying to build up an idea in my mind of exactly what I think is happening, but I think in a while I might stop. I need to switch off for a while, I need to sit still and try and remember what it was I came up here for in the first place.</p>
