<p>You know when you&#8217;re getting a sore throat? It&#8217;s like you&#8217;ve got something stuck at the back of your mouth. Like you&#8217;ve eaten something kind of bad and it&#8217;s not worked it&#8217;s way down yet. It&#8217;s such a frustrating feeling. I know what&#8217;s coming up, and there&#8217;s not a lot I can do about it.</p>

<p>Kirsty has gone &#8216;darn sarth&#8217; today to speak to important people at the Ford Motor Company. It&#8217;s the first meeting she&#8217;s got as part of her work trying to get companies to sponsor kids to go abroad and learn about different cultures (that&#8217;s a bit of a simplification but she&#8217;ll forgive me) all for the purpose of promoting world peace and understanding.</p>

<p>I on the other hand will be staring at computer screen all day, busily typing words and numbers and occasionally drinking coffee.</p>

<p>Good luck Kirsty.</p>
