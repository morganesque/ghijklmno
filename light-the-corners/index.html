<p>I made the stupid mistake of sticking an old old mix tape on last night. I wasn&#8217;t made for me or anything, just one I made a long time ago to listen to on my paper round or something. I think the only reason it&#8217;s survived so long is that at the very end it has a short outtake of &#8220;I Know Very Well How I Got My Name&#8221; by Morrissey which I luckily taped off the radio one day. The DJ was Terry Christian (of Word fame) and he begins the piece by saying &#8220;Don&#8217;t tape it even though it&#8217;s really rare&#8221; - what more encouragement could you give a young Morrissey fan??? The track ends with the guitarist getting a note wrong and he and Morrissey fall about laughing. It&#8217;s great.</p>

<p>The tape marks a very definite and short period of time in my youth. These were my favourite songs of the time and there&#8217;s only about 5 different bands on the whole tape (The Wonderstuff, Pele, CUD, a band called Magik (I think I was given that CD by a friend) and another band called Fat Lady Sings who we saw once supporting Pele and thought for a short time might turn out to be good - they didn&#8217;t). Most songs  I&#8217;ve still got but being on singles I doubt I&#8217;ve even listened to them more than a few times off the CD. I would always studiously copy them on long tapes and listen to them all together on the way to or from school, or like I said delivering papers.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s always a shock to hear something that you&#8217;ve literally not heard  at all for so long. It has to be something you only heard at the time and you&#8217;ve never experienced since, like the smell of a childhood holiday or the taste of the bubble gum they used to give away in packets of stickers. For me it&#8217;s nearly always music nowadays which in some ways is a shame because it&#8217;s biasing my nostalgia towards a certain time and particular events which looking back in reality were no more halcyon than any of my other days.</p>
