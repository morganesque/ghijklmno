<p>Well, at long last I&#8217;ve sorted the old CD writer problem. I can safely say now that (touch wood, fingers crossed, stand on one leg, sell my soul to Satan) I have a CD writer which works. I&#8217;m almost scared to even write it, in case it&#8217;s tempting fate too much. I mean I bought it on Saturday and it&#8217;s worked all weekend but what does that mean? It&#8217;s probably just about to break right now. It&#8217;s probably got some kind of work-for-two-days-then-brake built in mechanism.</p>

<p>Well anyway having got my money back for the last one I decided to just go out and replace it with something that was nigh on identical but just made by a different company, and it worked. One huge plus point was that while the previous one came with a cut down version of the software (with the rather annoying option to pay &pound;60 for an upgrade) this one comes with a full package and loads of documentation in such a way that you feel almost like they care whether it works when you get it home.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s still external and still connects via the new USB2 card I bought which is nice and by all indications it seems to even work fairly fast too. Granted my little computer can&#8217;t crank it up to the 40x speed advertised but I managed to get something approaching 15x which is a normal sized CD in just over 4mins - so I&#8217;m happy.</p>

<p>The only thing which is still a niggle, and oh so very ironic, is that one part of the software for new CD writer won&#8217;t install because it detects I haven&#8217;t got rid of the equivalent software from old CD writer. When trying then to un-install the old software I am prompted to put in the CD which I originally installed it from, which of course I took back to the shop with the old CD writer when I took that back. I&#8217;ve tried deleting all the files I could find which related to the old software but to no avail. The new software is still detecting it and will not download. It isn&#8217;t a huge deal, as it&#8217;s a small part of the package and not really one I&#8217;d definitely use so much. It&#8217;s very annoying though to think that the old CD writer is still spoiling things way after I took it back to the shop.</p>
