<p class="standfirst">What are links? When we say “link” we think of two things connected together. On the web we think of links taking us to different pages or sites but in fact they don't really connect those pages.</p>

A link on a website works more like a sign post. “Hey”, it says “look over there at that thing”. The link, in terms of a connection,  is in the heads of the author and viewer. We assume that a link will signpost us towards something that's connected in some way.

When we picture the internet we think of a network of linked documents. Only actually those links aren't two way things they're signposts. The direction of travel is always the same.

Of course this is no revelation. [Google’s search algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank) since the start was based on tracing back those links and assigning meaning to them.

Anyone who's ever poured over [referrer logs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_referer) has understood the power of looking at links from the opposite direction.

Before social media, when the blog was king, [trackbacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trackback) were invented as a way to make obvious on destination pages the different incoming links that existed on other blogs.

[Matt Webb](http://interconnected.org/home/), a long time ago, created a little experiment called [Dirk](http://interconnected.org/home/2006/08/24/dirk_is_back) (after the [Douglas Adams character](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirk_Gently)) which attempted to treat links more like links. Instead of creating a sign post you created actual links. They took the form "X is connected to Y because…” which meant that they consisted of 3 things. First the two things that were linked and secondly the link itself, explained.

What I like about this is that the link is an entity in itself. Not just the result or implication of signposting. It exists in its own right. I think this changes the nature of the relationship in a important way, but also opens up the potential for a different kind of experience.

When I was working on the [Pararchive](http://pararchive.com/) (latterly [Yarn](http://yarncommunity.com/)) project, this was an idea we toyed with for a while. We wanted to allow users to link up disparate things to tell stories about them. My thought then was that instead of creating implied links through grouping or sequencing items we could make the links explicit and even the main focus of story-telling. I still think this idea has legs although I think that creating a user interface which clearly and satisfyingly makes use of this is a challenge.

I think there’s something in this though. I imagine some tool that’s something like Dirk crossed with a Wiki. Something that allows the creation of web pages quickly and easily but where as well as creating inline hyperlinks there are also ways of creating explicit stand-alone links to connect these page to one another page and with some kind of text which explains the connection. My thought here is that in practice this would open up a much more organic form of information architecture. One where as well as tracing the edit history of the page (à la wikis) you could also trace the number of incoming links (à la Google) and the number of times those links were used. Using these things to both creates routes through the information but also to bring to the surface the most important or useful connections within it.
