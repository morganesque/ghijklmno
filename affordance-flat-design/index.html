<p>In which I wade into the flat design vs. skeuomorphism debate a meer two years after I first started thinking about it and when really the argument&#8217;s all but over and there&#39;s probably very little I can add to it.</p>
<!-- more -->
<p>Prompted by <a href="https://twitter.com/deanvipond/status/347017131516370944">this tweet</a> and <a href="http://zipapp.co.uk/">the website</a> it refers to I was thinking about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro_(design_language)" target="_blank">Metro</a> and the <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/trends/explore#q=skeuomorphism%2C%20flat%20design&amp;cmpt=q" target="_blank">whole flat design thing</a> and how there&#39;s a basic assumption at the bottom of it which underpins much of what they&#8217;ve done. An assumption which is also, I think, the main thing that&#8217;s caused the &quot;flat design&quot; paradigm to fail &ndash; when it has failed.</p>

<p><h3>Everything is interactive</h3></p>
<p>When you look at an interface do you assume everything is clickable? You&#39;re probably looking at one now. Is everything clickable? It used to be that it was probably very clear what was clickable and what wasn&#39;t. In applications you tended to have a frame around the main content (or activity) and this frame, which was usually a nice shade of grey, contained a load of things which looked like buttons or menus, or something recognisable like that.</p>

<p>Take <a href="http://mozillaquest.com/OpenSource02/graphics/MS_Word_2000_01_5may02_600x317.gif">MS Word &nbsp;in Windows 98</a> for example. You type your letter in the bottom bit, and above there&#39;s about a billion of those little buttons and each one can help you in some way. You start to learn what they do after a while but the first thing you learn is &quot;that is where I go to click things&quot;.</p>

<p>That place up there (or down there, or to the side) was referred to as &quot;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interface_chrome#User_interface_and_interaction_design">chrome</a>&quot;&nbsp;by some people. When the Metro guys started out one of the things they wanted to do was to get rid of that. The split between content and chrome didn&#39;t seem right anymore. So they wanted to make the content be the interface, so you could interact directly with it.</p>

<p>But in order to do that you need users to understand that they don&#39;t need to search out those little button-looking things anymore. As Mike Kruzeniski said in is wonderful <a href="http://kruzeniski.com/2011/how-print-design-is-the-future-of-interaction/" target="_blank">How Print Design is the Future of Interaction</a>&nbsp;post.</p>

<p><blockquote>Today however, most onscreen content is assumed to be interactive. The literal analog affordance is no longer necessary...</blockquote></p>
<p>I think the problem comes when that assumption doesn&#39;t hold. Not everyone assumes everything onscreen is interactive nowadays. Some people are thoroughly used to looking for skeuomorphism to guide them through interfaces, and there&#39;s no doubt that the optical illusion of three dimensions is eye catching in a <a href="http://drupal.zigguratt.com/blog/robertkamper/moon_shadows_or_the_deception_of_depth_perception" target="_blank">very fundamental way</a>. So why did they think they could do without such a valuable set of clues and cues to help users get around and use their interface?</p>

<p><h3>Not Just Flat</h3></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s check out the <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/jpalioto/windows-phone-7-overview-4714260/4">Metro design principles</a>&nbsp;though because they&#39;re great!&nbsp;OK number one (Clean, Light, Open, Fast) is pretty standard but yeah it&#8217;s cool. The second (Celebrate Typography) kind of pins their colours to the mast a little more, but still cool. The third one (Alive in Motion) is interesting as putting motion at the centre is fairly bold. Good motion design is often more of a nice-to-have than a fundamental part of UI design. The fourth principle (Content, Not Chrome) I&#8217;ve talked about above. And finally the fifth one (Authentically Digital) which is&nbsp;fascinating and throws up a load of questions.</p>

<p>Looking at this you can see the the removal of chrome is part of a larger whole. Not only in conjunction with solid design principles but also an emphasis on movement (which in&nbsp;essence&nbsp;means user feedback as interfaces don&#39;t usually move unless in response to a user action) and &nbsp;not only that but the whole thing is within a larger context of grappling with the question: &quot;What is authentically digital?&quot;.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t just about flat, although it can look that way.</p>

<p><h3>Touch &amp; The Children</h3></p>
<p>I think there&#39;s two factors which are key to a lot of this. First is the advent of the touch screen. Not only did touch bring with it a different paradigm of interactions but it also heralded a change in terms of space. Moving a little mouse pointer around a (comparatively&nbsp;large) monitor is not like jabbing your finger at an iPhone. There isn&#39;t the space anymore for the kind of chrome we&#8217;ve had in the past and forcing users to navigate through endless menu options isn&#39;t acceptable. Removing the chrome and making the content the interface is necessary.</p>

<p>Second, but related, is the fact that each generation growing with these new technologies forms their own norms and has their own expectations. With touch devices dominating more and more, I think children will start to grow up with some of the in-built assumptions upon which Metro is based. They will expect everything on screen to be clickable (jabbable, touchable) in some way. They won&#39;t need things to look like buttons, or menus, or lovely soft leathery handbags in order to know what to do with them. And maybe, just maybe they&#39;ll have some kind of a sense, in-built, and probably unexpressed, about what &quot;authentically digital&quot; is.</p>

<p><h3>Doing it Wrong</h3>
The website at the top takes almost none of these things into consideration. So few of it&#8217;s elements are clickable and it&#8217;s movement is decorative but little else. It also seems to have a crazy emphasis on mouse hover as trigger (wha?). Where it is usable it&#8217;s only where it makes concessions to chrome (the black bar at the top) not where it embraces the design principles of Metro.</p></p>
<p>It&#8217;s ironic that in producing a design which is little more than &quot;flat&quot; they&#8217;ve opened themselves up to being used as an example of why &quot;flat&quot; design is bad.</p>
