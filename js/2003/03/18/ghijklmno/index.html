<p>Hello!</p>




<p class="firstpar">Chances are you&#8217;ve probably arrived here coz you were going to look at my weblog which used to be  here:</p>




<p style="text-align:center"><a href="http://mydrawings.co.uk/writings/">http://mydrawings.co.uk/writings/</a>.</p>




<p class="firstpar"> Well as you can see it&#8217;s moved and got a new name and a different style and all sorts of things. Don&#8217;t ask me why? or how? or when? or "what in the hell are you thinking?", I really don&#8217;t know.</p>




<p>I do know that there&#8217;s something I like about this now which I didn&#8217;t like about how it was before. There&#8217;s something this has which was missing before. I mean "writings", what a crappy little name that really was, I bet you thought so. I bet you used to think "oh god are you that unimaginative?". Well yes probably I was, maybe now I&#8217;ve gone far too far in the other dirrection, but what the hell, I quite like it over here, I think I&#8217;ll stick around a while.</p>




<p>Also of course I was always on a loser with the domain &#8220;mydrawings.co.uk&#8221; which is great (and hopefully still is) as a place for drawings (especially mine) but not so good I felt, as a place for things that weren&#8217;t drawings. &#8220;Writings&#8221; to be specific.</p>




<p>So there you have it. Something in the way of a new beginning and probably nothing at all in the way of anything else new at all. So update your links, purge your bookmarks, rattle you teapots and settle down to a lot more of the same, only different and with pictures of three famous people at the top of the page.</p>




<p>Hey, you never know I might get sued for using them!!! There&#8217;s something to look forward to. ;o)</p>
