      <div class="post__content content"><p>This is a blog post which is just here as a way of writing a blog post to enable me to stop thinking that the next blog post needs to be a particularly good blog post in order to justify the gap between this blog post and the last blog post.</p>




<p>Procrastination is a fickle mistress. I&#8217;ve been aiming to, wanting to, and generally, definitely planning to write some more &ndash; and write it here specifically &ndash; for the longest time. I&#8217;ve got a drafts folder as long as my arm and even a post about my drafts folder which is sat in the drafts folder waiting for some made-up, not-going-to-happen thing to happen before I can get it out of the drafts folder and publish it.</p>




<p>I'm not going to fall into the trap of making some kind of promise (weekly posts!!) I won't keep, or of apologising to some imagined, long-departed audience for not having written anything recently. But having been <a href="http://us2.campaign-archive2.com/?u=13eb080d8a315477042e0d5b1&amp;id=9d79be8013&amp;e=56138f28e1">inspired</a> yet again to get my act togther and write something, I realised that the above feeling of expected quality was one barrier to me actually doing it and so if nothing else I thought I'd simply remove that barrier.</p>




<p>I doubt this will unleash a tsunami of quality content but hopefully it'll be one step long the way to something or other which is better than nothing or other. And just imagine, if in a year or so's time I still haven't written a single other thing on this blog then this blog post will look (and make me look) so comically rubbish then there might actually even be some value in that.</p>




<p>Wordpress says I&#8217;ve written almost 300 words now and that&#8217;s enough for any metaphorical sink plunger I'd have thought. Cheers.</p>
