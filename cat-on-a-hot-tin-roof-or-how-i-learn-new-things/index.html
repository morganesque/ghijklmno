<p>I&#8217;ve noticed a pattern with the way I learn new things which seems to repeat and yet is something I never able to sidestep or short cut even when I see it happening.</p>
<!-- more -->
<ol>
    <li>Hear about some new thing, that I don&#39;t know about. It sounds cool.</li>
    <li>Go and read about it. Can&#39;t really make much sense of it. Don&#39;t really have time to try it right now.</li>
    <li>Wait.</li>
    <li>Go back and download it; try it out. Don&#39;t get very far. This isn&#39;t cool after all. Oh the mendacity!</li>
    <li>Wait.</li>
    <li>Go back and try it again. Remember I&#8217;ve tried it once before and remember not getting very far. Look at it again for just long enough to remember all the things I saw previously and found confusing. At this point I give up (gracefully).</li>
    <li>Wait.</li>
    <li>Wait some more. This one can go on a while.</li>
    <li>Hear about it again. Somehow decide that this time I&#39;m going to crack it. This is like a switch clicking off in my head, completely uncontrollable by my conscious mind and yet I can tell when the it&#8217;s changed.</li>
    <li>Go back download it again. This time I also tend to Google something helpful like &quot;[the thing] tutorial&quot; or even &quot;[the thing] for beginners&quot; and somehow find just enough to give me an way in. Something which I understand and which leads me further into other territory, makes me understand the previous things I&#8217;ve read better.</li>
</ol>
<p>Then I get a wonderful feeling of elation and pride. Now I love how hard it was to learn because now it&#8217;s worth it. I&#8217;ve added another super power to my arsenal and this is now my favourite thing to mess with and use for at least a week or two. Occasionally I end up using things a lot, which is great.</p>

<p>I was going to list a few recent examples of this but as I was writing I realised that this really does apply to almost everything I&#8217;ve ever learned. For anyone interested the one which prompted this blog post was <a href="http://gruntjs.com/">grunt.js</a> which I&#39;m currently thinking is awesome!</p>

<p>This pattern is also kind of addictive. I have a few of these thing on the back burner almost constantly and given the chance there&#39;s always a fews candidates which could trigger &quot;the click&quot; at any one time. I&#39;m always on the lookout for new ones and often it feels like the supply of these ebbs and flows like a tide. If nothing has washed up for a while I start to get the feeling I&#39;m due.</p>

<p>I like to imagine this stems from a some kind of unquenchable thirst for knowledge I think probably it&#8217;s more likely that it comes from a childish need for novelty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is the victory of a cat on a hot tin roof? &mdash; I wish I knew... Just staying on it, I guess, as long as she can...&rdquo;</p>
