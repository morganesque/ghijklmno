<p>We&#8217;ve had guys round to do the roof; ADL and Sons. ADL was a very nice guy (his son I didn&#8217;t really speak to, except to say &#8217;there&#8217;s a coffee down here for you&#8217;) and it seems like they&#8217;ve done a smashing job. I say &#8220;seems&#8221; coz it&#8217;s right hard to see the damn thing without standing way way off down the street, and then it&#8217;s only really possible with the aid of a telescope or some binoculars. I do own a pair of binoculars but they&#8217;re just a tiny pair I got free from Jessops. I don&#8217;t know why Jessops were giving away tiny binoculars but they were. Maybe I was their thousandth customer or something.</p>

<p>Have you noticed that even though Jessops is like a national brand for photo-processing if you go to a different Jessops shop you can get a completely different service. I was in one Jessops recently and I was told that they didn&#8217;t transfer photo&#8217;s directly to CD (without having the film processed in the traditional manner also) - but why didn&#8217;t I try the different Jessops down the road. I was a bit disconcerted. I mean, you wouldn&#8217;t expect to walk into MacDonald&#8217;s and ask for a kebab only to be told that they &quot;didn&#8217;t do kebabs - but maybe you should try the McDonalds down the road.&quot;</p>

<p>Doesn&#8217;t brand consistency count for anything these days?</p>

<p>It turned out that neither Jessops would transfer my photo&#8217;s onto CD without first processing the film in the traditional manner - so maybe there was a semblance of consistency there after all.</p>

<p><b>Update</b>Maybe I should have mentioned the different packaging (Jessops or Kodak) that I&#8217;ve had photo&#8217;s come back in, maybe that was what I meant.</p>
