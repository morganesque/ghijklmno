<p>It&#8217;s undefined... possibly. Maybe it&#8217;s undefined or maybe it&#8217;s actually defined. We don&#39;t know. Given that calling a method is quite a common thing to do how is this better than &quot;there&#39;s something wrong&quot; in terms of helping you fix it.
<pre>1061: Call to a possibly undefined method X througha reference with static type Y</pre>Well, possibly a bit. Possibly. Anyway here&#39;s where I went wrong. Variable at the top of my (so I can access it everywhere) like so - it&#8217;s using a class I wrote for a different project (do you hear that? reusable code. I like totally rool!).
<pre>var thing:ClassA;</pre>I&#8217;ve not assigned anything to it yet I&#39;ll be doing that in the class somewhere. In fact here I am doing it now.
<pre>thing = new ClassA(var1, var2);</pre>So all is well and good until I realise that despite the joys and karmic benefits of reusable code ClassA just isn&#39;t going to cut it with this new project. It&#8217;s got the juice but I&#39;m going to be needing biscuits with that juice if you know what I mean (tell me if I&#39;m loosing you here).So a quick new class.
<pre>class ClassB extends ClassA{ /<em> new stuff </em>/}</pre>and a change to the code
<pre>thing = new ClassB(var1, var2);</pre>and I&#39;m away using the new stuff and making good things happen. But no... I get that error above there. I&#39;m scratching my head because as far as I know the whole thing with this class based OOP based programming shizzle is to do just that kind of thing. And the method is there. It&#8217;s fucking there. Look I extended ClassA and WROTE A NEW METHOD! Here it is! Aaaaarrgh! Anyway turns out (as usual) I&#39;d missed something. You see at the top of the class there when I defined the variable (but didn&#39;t assign anything to it) the variable was still being given a type of ClassA.
<pre>var thing:ClassA;</pre>and it seems that because of that, even though I assigned an object of type ClassB to it later on. It never really got over being a ClassA. In fact it as so attached to it&#8217;s status as a ClassA varaible it kind of ignored everything about ClassB that it didn&#39;t already know. Hence when I come to call on one of my new methods, they &quot;officially&quot; didn&#39;t exist. Possibly.</p>
