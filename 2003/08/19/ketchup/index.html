<p>A few recent events of note (I think):</p>




<ul>
<li>Went to Adele (Kirsty&#8217;s sister) and Martins wedding. An extremely enjoyable, not religious, back garden, lots of booze type of blur. Talked drunkenly to future relatives, ate a tasty curry, listened to the speeches (kudos to Kirsty&#8217;s Dad who did a great one - I even got a mention myself woo!) then adjourned to a hotel where for some reason our drinking seemed to take off like that lone runner in a marathon who leaves the pack and heads off on his own only to discover slightly later on that it was not a good idea and he really should have paced himself. Suffered next morning in that dry, bale of hay, gravelly throated way only drink can produce. They&#8217;re in Cancun now - all inclusive - nice!</li>
<li>Camera broke (hence no pics from said wedding). Took it back to shop with the receipt (thank God we found it!!) and the guy said it&#8217;d be about two weeks. It&#8217;s over two weeks since then so I gave them a ring. A nice woman said "I don&#8217;t know who told you two weeks but it&#8217;s usually a month, if not more". Excellent. I&#8217;m going in tomorrow to see if they can lend me a camera or something. I&#8217;m not holding my breath.</li>
<li>Decorated the bedroom. Well I say decorated, but actually we just painted everything white. It was cheap, and fairly simple (had to strip more blown vinyl from the ceiling - ugh!) and surprisingly effective. It&#8217;s made what used to me a dull, dim, slightly dank bedroom into a bright airy, slightly mediterranean looking bedroom. Thoroughly recommended I&#8217;d say.</li>
</ul>


<p class="firstpar">I think that&#8217;s yer lot.</p>
