<p>Remember I bought a CD writer - do you? I do. Fucking piece of arse!! I wrote a CD on Saturday morning for my long suffering friend <a href="http://sorehead.org">Kev</a> who&#8217;s been providing oodles of Tom Waits-ery recently without so much as a thankyou from me. So I thought I&#8217;d return the favour and provide some Scott Walker-ery for his listening pleasure. So I wrote the CD and it was good.</p>




<p>However, when I went to start the whole process again (for there was another) the CD writer just whirrred a bit and refused to accept that I had "put a blank CD into the drive". In fact it then on refused to accept that I&#8217;d put any CD in the drive. In the manual it says <i>"green light = drive empty, blue light = reading CD"</i>, the light stayed resolutely green throughout. So I turned the whole thing off and started again, but the same thing happened. So I turned it off and went for a coffee, on my return the same thing happened. So I forgot about it for a while.</p>




<p>Trouble was every time I passed the room I couldn&#8217;t help popping in and giving it another try. You know, just in case. This went on until Sunday morning.</p>




<p>On Sunday I was getting more desperate and more irate and was &#8220;giving it one more try&#8221; while chatting to Kirsty about whether Dixons would let me return the goddamn thing after a month. It wasn&#8217;t working and I was convinced that it wasn&#8217;t a software thing - the drive just wasn&#8217;t recognising a CD when I put it in. So I picked it up and turned it upside down, and it worked.</p>




<p>Then it worked fine (I put a number of different CD&#8217;s in there to check it) and so I wrote a second CD. This CD was good too, and then it stopped working again. Just like before.</p>
