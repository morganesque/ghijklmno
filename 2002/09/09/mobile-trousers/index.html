<p>Went to York on Saturday. I love York. It&#8217;s great. We were there because I&#8217;d bought Kirsty an <a href="http://www.codygifts.com/product/prodimage.asp?picturecode=134080&amp;feature=28">aromatherapy massage experience</a> for her birthday and she&#8217;d chosen to have it done at a place behind Lloyds Pharmacy on Gillygate in York.</p>




<p> While she was having it done I wandered around York for a while and shopped for new trousers. At one point I was in River Island (yeah I know, but at least it wasn&#8217;t Gap) just about try on a possible pair of pants when my mobile rang. It was someone from work saying a rugby match report hadn&#8217;t come through properly. I didn&#8217;t say where I was (other than I was in York so I couldn&#8217;t dial in) and tried to help. It&#8217;s slightly embarrassing to be on your mobile in changing rooms at the best of times (I imagine) but extra embarrassing to be stood with a new pair of trousers around your ankles spouting the work-jargon required to sort this work-problem out.</p>




<p><i>yeah, try /usr/local/opn ...</i></p>




<p><i>have a look in the PHP template, see if it&#8217;s looping through on a league acronym or a competition code</i></p>




<p>Anyway having got to the end of that phone call (not completely sucessfully) I got back to trying on the trousers, and was just about to pull on another pair when the blessed phone rings again. Work again, although a different person this time with a different problem.</p>




<p>I walked out of the changing rooms having spent something like 20 mins seemingly trying on two pairs of trousers.</p>




<p>I bougt one of them though so that was nice.</p>
