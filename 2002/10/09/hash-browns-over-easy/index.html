<p>Went to <a href="http://sorehead.org">Kev&#8217;s</a> for some wonderful chile (not in a bowl - but in fact on a bed of tortilla&#8217;s which was a new experience and a very nice one at that). We also got to see the vast mansion he now lives in (don&#8217;t let him telll you otherwise - it&#8217;s lies I tell ya, all lies). It was strange because having worked with Kev for over 2 years now and having heard all sorts of things about his home life without ever actually seeing him at home I found it all strangely familiar.</p>




<p>There&#8217;s the sofa that he was worried about fitting in the van, there&#8217;s the huge collection of CD&#8217;s (the latter portion of which I&#8217;ve watched him buy), there&#8217;s the shower curtain and there&#8217;s the new iMac (looking far bigger and sturdier than I&#8217;d imagined).</p>




<p>On the way home having taken just one more wrong turning for good luck (we took about five on the way there), we both agreed that a good time was very much had and that we&#8217;d have to have him over to ours very soon.</p>
