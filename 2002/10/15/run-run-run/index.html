<p>OK time to out myself. Time to leap from my closet and tell the world. I have something to say, it may surprise you, it may disgust you, but I feel I&#8217;ve kept silent too long.</p>




<p>I&#8217;ve been jogging</p>




<p>No, I don&#8217;t mean I&#8217;ve done it in the past. I mean I&#8217;ve been doing it again. It began just over a week ago (the weekend before last). We&#8217;d been talking about getting some exercise (I&#8217;ve been talking about it for years now) and we&#8217;d even discussed investing in one of those swish treadmill running ma-thingies which we decided we could just about squeeze in. However before we went all out with the buying, it was decided that we should maybe try the normal, real, outside, proper sort of running instead. And so it was, that last Sunday morning we set off and ran round the block. It took 15 mins and it was actually quite good fun (this was probably mainly to do with the lovely crisp autumn weather and less to do with the jogging, but none the less...). So the next morning I did it again. And the next, and the next.</p>




<p>Now I know what you&#8217;re thinking. "Whoah there sonny, if you&#8217;re not careful you&#8217;ll end up fit or something". Well yes I am aware of that and rest assured I&#8217;ll be upping my ice cream and beer intake to compensate.</p>
