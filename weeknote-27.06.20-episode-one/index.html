        <p>Right, so, well, hmm… let’s see about this then, shall we?</p>
<p><img class="img-full" src="/img/2020/weeknotes1.jpg" /></p>
<p>I thought I’d try and do some weeknotes. I’ve been writing things for myself for a while now but nothing I’ve ever wanted to share. It’s been more a stream of thoughts, almost in a Morning Pages way, only once a week, as a record. Recently I’ve thought it would be nice to do something more “in the open”. And that some kind of weeknoting would be a good exercise.</p>
<p>I’ve always been a fan of the idea that a blog should be your brain, over time, on the internet. But I’ve struggled not to be a bit too perfectionist with the stuff I tend to write on my blog. I’ve felt like the less I’d written recently the higher the bar should be for the next thing I wrote. This predictably created a spiral of self-doubt and procrastination. That, in turn, lead to even less writing and an ever-higher bar-raising.</p>
<p>But I do think there’s something useful in regular writing. And I’m feeling more and more lately that a sense of rhythm and discipline are something that I need to embrace.</p>
<p>Have you read Switch by Chip and Dan Heath? It’s one of the best self-helpy books I’ve read. It’s well written, with a great central premise. It helps you to understand things and motivates you to do things. So anyway, read that.
The point is that cultivating habits, good habits, is something Chip &amp; Dan recommend. As is making them manageable and not setting your ambitions too high at first. Hence wanting to find a way to side-step the self-imposed pressure and perfectionism of my other attempts at blogging.</p>
<p>So I have a plan.</p>
<p>a) I’ll keep it under 500 words. Maybe less even, let’s see.</p>
<p>b) I won’t try to do justice to the whole week or list everything I’ve done. I’ll try and record in some way where my brain is at, over time, on the internet.</p>
<p>c) And I’ll try very hard to hit publish once a week.</p>
<p>I’m going to try to make sure I don’t hold myself to high standards of coherence, and I will attempt to keep myself from worrying about tying things up in a neat little bow at the end. This week I thought I’d ease in with a “why and how” one. Next week I will begin putting the world to rights in earnest. :-)</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>
