        <p>File under: <a href="/grand-narratives/">All stories are wrong but some are useful</a></p>

<p>First there was Software and not enough people in organisations understood it. The experts were on the outside so it made sense to outsource Software to them. So Software became something you bought. For the experts it became something you sold, and so salesmen started to play a greater role. It also became something you could profit from and so instead of playing to the strengths of software, the experts played to the strengths of the salesmen and tried to turn software into a product. They sold “solutions” that they’d already built, that they could sell to lots of other people too. They produced software to a specification and got paid when the specification was met and the Software Product was delivered.</p>

<p>This was not the best for software, and didn’t produce the best software for each situation. Look at the internal systems (intranet, resource management, e-learning) that your organisation probably still uses. It wasn’t tailored to your specific needs. It was bought and people attempted to make it fit, or worse, made people change to fit it.</p>

<p>Over time a consensus emerged amongst the experts creating software about how to play to software’s strengths. Software is inherently changeable in a way that things like buildings and spoons just aren’t. By playing to that strength you can create tools and services which are far better suited to the needs of the people who are using them. You can tailor your solutions for different situations.</p>

<p>The trouble with that consensus is that it didn’t work for the salesmen. They still needed ready-made, pre-built solutions that they could sell to customers for a fixed price. What the experts were advocating would mean a messy on-going kind of relationship with the customer, where deliverables were less tangible and where the thing being paid for was less the Software and more just the expertise.</p>

<p>Luckily at around this time people within organisations were getting to grips more with software. There was less fear around it and people could see a bit more clearly how it could be done. This coupled with the consensus that the experts had built made this a perfect time to start bringing the experts back in house. In this way the experts could be freed from the straightjacket of trying to produce saleable products and could start playing to software’s strengths, and the organisation could start to get software solutions which were tailored more specifically to its needs.</p>

<p>And so here we find ourselves.</p>

<p>The trouble is that this change has not been wholesale and is not yet complete. There are still legions of salesmen attempting to sell us ready-mades and there are still a lot of people who’s only experience of software is as a product that must be bought and then accepted with all it’s faults. It is strange to come in on this wave of change and still find the old ways persisting. To be faced with this anachronism not just in the legacy systems but also in ongoing activity.</p>

<p>The worry is that the change could be slowed or stopped by those with vested interests in the way things were. I’m hoping that won’t happen.</p>
